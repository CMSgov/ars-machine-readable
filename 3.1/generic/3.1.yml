  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Access Control policies and procedures form the foundation that allows privacy protections to be implemented for the identified uses of personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI). Privacy requirements commonly use the terms "adequate security"and "confidentiality"when referring to access controls and other security safeguards for PII. Applied together, these terms signify the need to make risk-based decisions based on the magnitude of harm (to both organizations and individuals) when determining applicable restrictions for PII. For this overlay, refer to the definitions of "adequate security"in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, and "confidentiality"in NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 1, Appendix B. These definitions are consistent with Committee for National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) No. 4009.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system account types include, for example, individual, shared, group, system, guest/anonymous, emergency, developer/manufacturer/vendor, temporary, and service. Some of the account management requirements listed can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or CISO) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Account management is a critical function for developing and implementing an access control framework that is appropriate for the information contained in systems and applications. When implemented effectively, the access control framework provides the necessary constructs for controlling access to PII, limiting disclosure of records about individuals to only those system and application users that have a need for the information to perform their job functions. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user access to PHI and PII.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The identification of authorized users and access privileges include considerations of whether the user will need access to PHI and whether such access may be permitted or required under HIPAA. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user access to PHI. Organizations should establish procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information, to include during an emergency.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Shared/group accounts do not provide the necessary accountability (such as non-repudiation) required to log and monitor access to sensitive information nor do they permit identification of individuals who have a need for access. Shared/group accounts also do not provide audit trails capable of associating a user with an action—eliminating the ability to establish non-repudiation. (Non-repudiation is a critical element of accountability and accuracy of information in systems, database or system history, and related logs and is important for investigating privacy incidents and breaches.)Refer to RMH for account management process and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Access to PII is more effectively controlled when access controls are considered during system design and built-into or enforced by the system (i.e., automated controls).Shared/group accounts that do not allow for uniquely attributing user activities should not be used for information systems that contain PII or PHI. Shared/group accounts do not allow for the necessary accountability (such as non-repudiation) required to log and monitor access to PII and PHI nor do they permit identification of individuals who have a need for access. Shared/group accounts do not permit audit trails to associate a user with an action, eliminating the ability to establish non-repudiation. Non-repudiation is a critical element of accountability and accuracy of information in systems, database or system history, and related logs and is important for investigating privacy incidents and breaches.

In addition to enforcing authorized access at the information system level and recognizing that information systems can host many applications and services in support of organizational missions and business operations, access enforcement mechanisms can also be employed at the application and service level to provide increased information security.For minimum authentication requirements, refer to RMH, Volume III, Standard 3.1, CMS Authentication Standards.Well-designed, automated access controls (e.g., mandatory access control [MAC], discretionary access control [DAC], role-based access control [RBAC], or attribute-based access control [ABAC]) limit user access to information per defined access policies, which helps ensure the security and confidentiality of sensitive information contained in the system.FIPS 140-2 validation certificate numbers are listed at:  <http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm>"

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information systems can only protect organizational information within the confines of established system boundaries. Additional security safeguards may be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the established information system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system boundary include transmitting information to an external information system or printing the information on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable to determine the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external information systems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the security provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example, if the information system passes information to another system controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security attributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the realm of an information system or organization.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    PII released outside a system boundary may be at increased risk for unauthorized access and use (i.e., a breach). Such release could include a formal process or an informal activity, such as a spreadsheet receiving data extracted from an information system.Applicable policy mandates establishing policy regarding access to PII, including PHI, are the Privacy Act of 1974, E-Government Act of 2002 (Section 208), and HIPAA.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information flow control regulates where information can travel within an information system and between information systems (as opposed to who can access the information) and without explicit regard to subsequent accesses to that information. Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example:

    (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only);
    (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and
    (iii) implementing trustworthy regarding mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.

    Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. NIST SP 800-53 control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology products.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The information flow enforcement controls provide a technical means of implementing disclosure requirements by minimizing information shared between networks, devices, and individuals within information systems and between interconnected systems. This control can also limit information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organization-defined security policy filters can address data structures and content. For example, security policy filters for data structures can check for maximum file lengths, maximum field sizes, and data/file types (for structured and unstructured data). Security policy filters for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word filters), enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits the interpretation of data content by applications. Unstructured data typically refers to digital information without a data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate the development of rule sets to address the sensitivity of the information conveyed by the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured data consists of:

    (i) bitmap objects that are inherently non-language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and
    (ii) textual objects that are based on written or printed languages (e.g., commercial off-the-shelf word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails).

    Organizations can implement more than one security policy filter to meet information flow control objectives (e.g., employing clean word lists in conjunction with dirty word lists may help to reduce false positives).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Security policy filters, or like technology, such as data loss prevention (DLP), can provide a form of continuous monitoring for compliance with privacy laws and regulations. Implementation of this security control reduces the potential for unauthorized transfer of PII.

    Ensure that the minimum-security controls identified in this overlay for PHI are in place to protect the data before transferring data between security domains. The confidentiality of PHI is better protected when a system can automatically detect data types and usage when being transferred from one security domain to another. This includes, for example, transfers between systems having different access controls with only a limited set of users allowed access to the PHI.

NIST defines a security domain as a domain that implements a security policy and is administered by a single authority.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    To provide the ability for an organization to monitor and prevent transfer of PII across different security domains, a system needs to have mechanisms to automatically detect, and where appropriate, prohibit the unauthorized transfer of PII across different security domains. Typical implementations of such controls will detect data types or metadata tagging and act to prevent the transfer of the information beyond the intended boundaries.The organization ensures systems containing moderate and high PII confidentiality impact level information include the capability for the organization to centrally monitor for and detect unauthorized transfer of such PII across different security domains. Some technologies that would facilitate this include data-loss prevention, data-rights management, and key-word detection to prevent the unauthorized export of information from a network or to render such information unusable in the event of the unauthorized export of such information between security domains.

    Attribution is a critical component of a security concept of operations. The ability to identify source and destination points for information flowing in information systems, allows the forensic reconstruction of events when required, and encourages policy compliance by attributing policy violations to specific organizations/individuals. Successful domain authentication requires that information system labels distinguish among systems, organizations, and individuals involved in preparing, sending, receiving, or disseminating information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The ability to identify source and destination points for PII flow within information systems is necessary for attribution and compliance with need to know requirements. Implement a higher level of granularity for identification and authentication based on sensitivity of the PII. This is not to determine permissibility of the transfer but to enable an audit capability.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Separation of duties addresses the potential for abuse of authorized privileges and helps to reduce the risk of malevolent activity without collusion. Separation of duties includes, for example:

    (i) dividing mission functions and information system support functions among different individuals and/or roles;
    (ii) conducting information system support functions with different individuals (e.g., system management, programming, configuration management, quality assurance and testing, and network security); and
    (iii) ensuring security personnel administering access control functions do not also administer audit functions.

    Separation of duties aligns privileges with appropriate roles with the idea that duties are split between roles in such a way as to reduce the risk of malevolent or inappropriate behaviors based on access. Implementing this control helps reduce the risk of inappropriate access to sensitive information (e.g., separating employees that perform security investigations from mission and business functions).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Separation of duties aligns privileges with appropriate roles with the idea that duties are split between roles in such a way as to reduce the risk of malevolent or inappropriate behaviors based on access. Implementing this control helps reduce the risk of inappropriate access to PII (e.g., separating employees that perform security investigations from mission and business functions).Separation of duties is implemented by designating a selected set of administrators the capability to set user permissions to PII and PHI information, while those administrators do not themselves have access to the PII and PHI. The principle of separation of duties is significant for developers as well as for operational system administrators.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    HIPAA requires the separation of duties to ensure that checks and balances are designed into the system to limit the effect of any given end user to control the entire process. Roles and responsibilities should be divided so that a single end user cannot subvert a critical process. This practice divides the tasks related to maintaining system security among different personnel such that no single individual could compromise PHI.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations employ least privilege for specific duties and information systems. The principle of least privilege is also applied to information system processes, ensuring that the processes operate at privilege levels no higher than necessary to accomplish required organizational missions/business functions. Organizations consider the creation of additional processes, roles, and information system accounts as necessary, to achieve least privilege. Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.The concept of least privilege aligns with the notion of only allowing access to sensitive information when an individual has a need-to-know in performance of their job duties.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The concept of least privilege aligns with the notion of only allowing access to PII when an individual has a need-to-know in performance of their job duties.The organization enforces the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or access needed by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) for the performance of specified tasks —increasing the level of restriction as PII confidentiality impact level rises. The organization ensures that users who must access records containing PII only have access to the minimum amount of PII, along with only those privileges (e.g., read, write, execute) necessary to perform their assigned tasks.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    HIPAA requires least privilege to satisfy both the Minimum Necessary Rule and access control safeguards.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Security functions include, for example, establishing system accounts, configuring access authorizations (i.e., permissions, privileges), setting events to be audited, and setting intrusion detection parameters. Security-relevant information includes, for example, filtering rules for routers/firewalls, cryptographic key management information, configuration parameters for security services, and access control lists. Explicitly authorized personnel include, for example, security administrators, system and network administrators, system security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other privileged users.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Limiting access to security functions to authorized personnel reduces the number of users able to perform certain security functions, such as configuring access permissions, setting audit logs, performing system management functions. Examples of authorized personnel include security administrators, system and network administrators, system security officers, system maintenance personnel, system programmers, and other privileged users. These types of security functions can provide a level of access to PII, and capabilities to manipulate it, in ways that other users' roles typically could not.The organization identifies the security relevant functions that require authorized access for all information systems that contain moderate or high PII confidentiality impact level information.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control enhancement limits exposure when operating from within privileged accounts or roles. The inclusion of roles addresses situations where organizations implement access control policies such as RBAC and where a change of role provides the same degree of assurance in the change of access authorizations for both the user and all processes acting on behalf of the user as would be provided by a change between a privileged and non-privileged account.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    This control requires system users with elevated privileges to use their non-privileged accounts when performing non-security functions. Requiring system users to use their non-privileged accounts when working with PII for purposes other than security functions limits inadvertent access to or disclosure of PII and protects the integrity of PII.Any access involving PII that is non-administrative in nature should require the user to use their non-privileged accounts to perform that function.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Privileged accounts, including super user accounts, are typically described as system administrator for various types of COTS operating systems. Restricting privileged accounts to specific personnel or roles prevents day-to-day users from having access to privileged information/functions. Organizations may differentiate in the application of this control enhancement between allowed privileges for local accounts and for domain accounts provided organizations retain the ability to control information system configurations for key security parameters and as otherwise necessary to sufficiently mitigate risk.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    This control limits who is authorized to administrative accounts, such as those who can perform security functions, which include configuring access permissions, setting audit logs and performing system management functions. These types of system and network management personnel typically have a level of access that is capable of circumventing other access controls. Limiting access to these accounts further protects sensitive information by limiting the number of individuals that have the "keys to the kingdom"on a network or system.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    The need for certain assigned user privileges may change over time reflecting changes in organizational missions/business function, environments of operation, technologies, or threat. Periodic review of assigned user privileges is necessary to determine if the rationale for assigning such privileges remains valid. If the need cannot be revalidated, organizations take appropriate corrective actions.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Review of user privileges is necessary to ensure privileges are revoked for those who no longer require access to sensitive information. Implementation of this control reduces the risk of unauthorized access to sensitive information by users who no longer need access to perform their job functions.

    Misuse of privileged functions, either intentionally or unintentionally by authorized users, or by unauthorized external entities that have compromised information system accounts, is a serious and ongoing concern and can have significant adverse impacts on organizations. Auditing the use of privileged functions is one way to detect such misuse, and in doing so, help mitigate the risk from insider threats and the advanced persistent threat (BYOD).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Privileged functions have elevated permissions to access, and grant access, to sensitive information. Accountability requires the ability to detect, trace, and audit a privileged function whenever it is executed.

    Privileged functions include, for example, establishing information system accounts, performing system integrity checks, or administering cryptographic key management activities. Non-privileged users are individuals that do not possess appropriate authorizations. Circumventing intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms or malicious code protection mechanisms are examples of privileged functions that require protection from non-privileged users.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Non-privileged users may not have the same level of trust as privileged users. Privileged functions have access beyond that of the typical user, and as such may have greater ability to access sensitive information. Individual accountability requires the ability to trace (audit) the actions of the user who initiated them.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    The warning banner language has very important legal implications for CMS and its information system resources. Should content need to be added to this banner, submit the modified warning banner language to the CMS CIO for review and approval prior to implementation. If an information system has character limitations related to the warning banner display, the CMS CIO can provide an abbreviated warning banner version. If this banner is inconsistent with any directives, policies, regulations, or standards, notify the CMS CIO immediately.All information system computers and network devices under CMS control, prominently display the notice and consent banner immediately upon users' authentication to the system, including, but not limited to, websites, web pages where substantial personal information from the public is collected, Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), Secure Shell (SSH), or other services accessed.System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    System use notification (e.g., logon banner) does not satisfy the requirement for Privacy Act Statements or Privacy Act system of records notice, when applicable; see TR-1 and TR2. System use notifications are the primary, interactive vehicle for notifying system users prior to accessing a system of the organization's monitoring practices and reminding users that unauthorized use is both prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties. The system use notification requires explicit action from the system user to acknowledge the notice before they can enter the system. Notices on system use are principally intended to convey information regarding consent to monitor (and other security-relevant information). These notices may also be, in some instances, an appropriate means to remind system users that the system being accessed contains sensitive PII and requires due care (e.g., a logon banner on an employee management system).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Note that System Use Notification does not satisfy the requirement for privacy notice under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations may define the maximum number of concurrent sessions for information system accounts globally, by account type (e.g., privileged user, non-privileged user, domain, specific application), by account, or a combination. For example, organizations may limit the number of concurrent sessions for system administrators or individuals working in particularly sensitive domains or mission-critical applications. This control addresses concurrent sessions for information system accounts and does not address concurrent sessions by single users via multiple system accounts.A session is defined as an encounter between an end-user interface device (e.g., computer, terminal, process) and an application, including a network logon. One user session is the time between starting the application and quitting. Some systems may require concurrent user sessions to function properly. However, based on the operational needs, automated mechanisms limit the number of concurrent user sessions. It is good practice to have management's approval for any system to have user concurrent sessions. Management should review the need for user concurrent sessions within every three hundred sixty-five (365) days.

    Session locks are temporary actions taken when users stop work and move away from the immediate vicinity of information systems but do not want to log out because of the temporary nature of their absences. Session locks are implemented where session activities can be determined. This is typically at the operating system level, but can also be at the application level. Session locks are not an acceptable substitute for logging out of information systems, for example, if organizations require users to log out at the end of workdays.This control protects sensitive information from unauthorized access when system users are away from their workstation. Since 2007, OMB has required session lock for remote and mobile devices, a standard which is neither technically nor financially burdensome. Based on risk, many agencies have adopted 15-minute session locks by policy as a best practice.Remote connections, as defined under AC-17, originate from outside the system boundary. Internal connections originate within the system boundary.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the termination of user-initiated logical sessions in contrast to SC-10, which addresses the termination of network connections that are associated with communications sessions (i.e., network disconnect). A logical session (for local, network, and remote access) is initiated whenever a user (or process acting on behalf of a user) accesses an organizational information system. Such user sessions can be terminated (and thus terminate user access) without terminating network sessions. Session termination terminates all processes associated with a user's logical session except those processes that are specifically created by the user (i.e., session owner) to continue after the session is terminated. Conditions or trigger events requiring automatic session termination can include, for example, organization-defined periods of user inactivity, targeted responses to certain types of incidents, time-of-day restrictions on information system use.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The session termination control requires implementing functionality to prevent unauthorized use of an established user session. This control protects sensitive information from unauthorized access when system users have initiated a session.

    This control addresses situations in which organizations determine that no identification or authentication is required in organizational information systems. Organizations may allow a limited number of user actions without identification or authentication, including, for example, when individuals access public websites or other publicly accessible federal information systems, when individuals use mobile phones to receive calls, or when facsimiles are received. Organizations also identify actions that normally require identification or authentication but may under certain circumstances (e.g., emergencies), allow identification or authentication mechanisms to be bypassed. Such bypasses may occur, for example, via a software-readable physical switch that commands bypass of the logon functionality and is protected from accidental or unmonitored use. This control does not apply to situations where identification and authentication have already occurred and are not repeated, but rather to situations where identification and authentication have not yet occurred. Organizations may decide that there are no user actions that can be performed on organizational information systems without identification and authentication and thus, the values for assignment statements can be none.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information is represented internally within information systems using abstractions known as data structures. Internal data structures can represent different types of entities, both active and passive. Active entities, also known as subjects, are typically associated with individuals, devices, or processes acting on behalf of individuals. Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information. These attributes may be associated with active entities (i.e., subjects) that have the potential to send or receive information, to cause information to flow among objects, or to change the information system state. These attributes may also be associated with passive entities (i.e., objects) that contain or receive information. The association of security attributes to subjects and objects is referred to as binding and is typically inclusive of setting the attribute value and the attribute type. Security attributes when bound to data/information, enables the enforcement of information security policies for access control and information flow control, either through organizational processes or information system functions or mechanisms. The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant. The term security labeling refers to the association of security attributes with subjects and objects represented by internal data structures within organizational information systems, to enable information system-based enforcement of information security policies. Security labels include, for example, access authorizations, data life cycle protection (i.e., encryption and data expiration), nationality, affiliation as contractor, and classification of information in accordance with legal and compliance requirements. The term security marking refers to the association of security attributes with objects in a human-readable form, to enable organizational process-based enforcement of information security policies. The AC-16 control represents the requirement for user-based attribute association (marking). The control enhancements to AC-16 represent additional requirements, including information system-based attribute association (labeling). Types of attributes include, for example, classification level for objects and clearance (access authorization) level for subjects. An example of a value for both attribute types is Top Secret.Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of currently defined security attributes, values, and ranges.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Implementation of this control provides a technical means to enforce security and privacy policies, e.g., access controls and encryption. Parameter values specified by the Privacy Overlays for this control include meta-data that supports privacy.Using the security attributes listed in this control's parameter values section enables cross system functionality and reciprocity through consistent security attribute interpretation. This control supports privacy protections by assigning security attributes that characterize information, devices, or processes (i.e., an "object") as containing PII or associate an organization's mandatory security/privacy training requirement with a user (i.e., a "subject") of an information system containing PII. The terms "Subject"and "Object"are defined in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4, Appendix B, Glossary. Security attributes are meta-data about either a subject or an object. Other security attributes may exist for other requirements beyond privacy. If an organization creates security attributes it should be cognizant of the risk associated with including PII in that meta-data. However, PII is not included in the security attributes for the parameter values specified below.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The parameter values for PHI enable policies, procedures, and data classification schemas that specify the application of administrative, technical, physical controls of a specific workstation or class of workstation that maintains electronic PHI.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Remote access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) communicating through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted VPNs to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs, does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this control. Enforcing access restrictions for remote connections is addressed in AC-3.For minimum authentication requirements, refer to RMH, Volume III, Standard 3.1, CMS Authentication Standards.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Limiting access to personally identifiable information (PII) from remote networks and/or restricting activities that can be conducted with PII remotely reduces the risk of intentional and unintentional disclosures of PII that may not exist on an internal network.Allow remote access to PII only with two-factor authentication where one of the factors is provided by a device separate from the computer gaining access.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Implement technical security measures to guard against unauthorized remote access to electronic PHI that is being transmitted over an electronic communications network.

    Automated monitoring and control of remote access sessions allows organizations to detect cyber-attacks and ensure ongoing compliance with remote access policies by auditing connection activities of remote users on a variety of information system components (e.g., servers, workstations, notebook computers, smart phones, and tablets).Auditing remote access ensures unauthorized connections to information systems containing sensitive information can be detected across all information system platforms (e.g., servers, mobile devices, work stations).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Auditing remote access ensures unauthorized connections to information systems containing personally identifiable information (PII) can be detected across all information system platforms (e.g., servers, mobile devices, work stations).Audit all remote access to, and actions on, resources containing PII.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    A mobile device is a computing device that:

    (i) has a small form factor such that it can easily be carried by a single individual;
    (ii) is designed to operate without a physical connection (e.g., wirelessly transmit or receive information);
    (iii) possesses local, non-removable or removable data storage; and
    (iv) includes a self-contained power source. Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations.

    Examples include smart phones, e-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually near the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls. AC-20 addresses mobile devices that are not organization-controlled.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Limiting access to sensitive information from mobile devices reduces the risk of intentional and unintentional disclosures sensitive information PII that may not exist on an internal network.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Container-based encryption provides a more fine-grained approach to the encryption of data/information on mobile devices, including, for example, encrypting selected data structures such as files, records, or fields. FIPS 140-2 approved security function families are found at  <http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cavp/validation.html>. However, implementing an approved security function is the start. The product must also be on the approved validation lists. (See  <http://csrc.nist.gov/groups/STM/cmvp/documents/140-1/140val-all.htm> for a list of current validated products.)

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Since mobile devices are more likely to be lost or stolen, sensitive information on a mobile device is more vulnerable. Encryption reduces this vulnerability.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    External information systems are information systems or components of information systems that are outside of the authorization boundary established by organizations and for which organizations typically have no direct supervision and authority over the application of required security controls or the assessment of control effectiveness. External information systems include, for example:

    (i) personally owned information systems/devices (e.g., notebook computers, smart phones, tablets, personal digital assistants);
    (ii) privately owned computing and communications devices resident in commercial or public facilities (e.g., hotels, train stations, convention centers, shopping malls, or airports);
    (iii) information systems owned or controlled by non-federal governmental organizations; and
    (iv) federal information systems that are not owned by, operated by, or under the direct supervision and authority of organizations.

    This control also addresses the use of external information systems for the processing, storage, or transmission of organizational information, including, for example, accessing cloud services (e.g., infrastructure as a service, platform as a service, or software as a service) from organizational information systems.For some external information systems (i.e., information systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to those agencies), the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. Information systems within these organizations would not be considered external. These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations. Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through  <http://www.medicare.gov>). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information systems; and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.For some external systems, those systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to CMS, the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. In effect, the information systems of these organizations would not be considered external.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Access to PII from external information systems (including, but not limited to, personally owned information systems/devices) is reinforced by a binding agreement to terms and conditions of the organization's privacy requirements to ensure awareness and accountability of both parties.Such agreements may include memoranda of understanding (MOU), terms of service, or contracts.

    This control enhancement recognizes that there are circumstances where individuals using external information systems (e.g., contractors, coalition partners) need to access organizational information systems. In those situations, organizations need confidence that the external information systems contain the necessary security safeguards (i.e., security controls), so as not to compromise, damage, or otherwise harm organizational information systems. Verification that the required security controls have been implemented can be achieved, for example, by third-party, independent assessments, attestations, or other means, depending on the confidence level required by organizations.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    An external information system which processes, stores, or transmits sensitive information needs to have its security controls verified to meet the organization's security control requirements for information systems processing sensitive information.

        including confiscation, in consultation with the organization's counsel, if
        necessary to remove the PII.
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Non-organizationally owned devices include devices owned by other organizations (e.g., federal/state agencies, contractors) and personally owned devices. There are risks to using non-organizationally owned devices. In some cases, the risk is sufficiently high as to prohibit such use. In other cases, it may be such that the use of non-organizationally owned devices is allowed but restricted in some way. Restrictions include, for example:

    (i) requiring the implementation of organization-approved security controls prior to authorizing such connections;
    (ii) limiting access to certain types of information, services, or applications;
    (iii) using virtualization techniques to limit processing and storage activities to servers or other system components provisioned by the organization; and
    (iv) agreeing to terms and conditions for usage. For personally owned devices, organizations consult with the Office of the General Counsel regarding legal issues associated with using such devices in operational environments, including, for example, requirements for conducting forensic analyses during investigations after an incident.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Mobile devices are more vulnerable to loss or theft than other types of computing media (e.g., desktops and servers) due to their portability and widespread use inside and outside of government facilities. This means PII stored on a mobile device is more vulnerable. This security control implements protections for PII contained on any mobile device not owned by the organization, including personal mobile devices, commonly referred to as BYOD.The organization should include in its mobile strategy a method to ensure both the device's access to PII can be revoked and the device's PII contents can be remotely removed.

    This control applies to information that may be restricted in some manner (e.g., privileged medical information, contract-sensitive information, proprietary information, personally identifiable information (PII), classified information related to special access programs or compartments) based on some formal or administrative determination. Depending on the information-sharing circumstances, sharing partners may be defined at the individual, group, or organizational level. Information may be defined by content, type, security category, or special access program/compartment.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    When PII is shared, it is necessary to ensure the PII is being shared in accordance with statutory and regulatory requirements, including any restrictions on how the PII may be shared and the requirements for security of the receiving partner.This control addresses the sharing of information in a general sense (i.e., disclosure). It is not "information sharing"as defined by the Information Sharing Environment (ISE) Privacy Guidelines. All sharing partners, processes, and information systems must comply with applicable system of records notices (SORN), Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA), or other forms of notice or public statements. Examples of actions that may be required to implement privacy requirements in information sharing activities include: addressing privacy requirements in information sharing agreements; ensuring sharing partners have a mutual understanding of the PII confidentiality impact level (as NIST SP 800-122 is a risk based analysis and accepts variation in organizational implementation); developing processes and supporting mechanisms to ensure/enforce compliance; and implementing technical capabilities that enforce privacy requirements for PII stored or processed by a sharing partner. Program managers and system owners should work with their privacy offices to ensure information sharing activities are compliant with privacy requirements.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The CMS Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) may permit a business associate to create, receive, maintain, or transmit PHI on behalf of the organization to the extent the business associate is required by law to perform such function or activity, without meeting the requirements of a business associate contract, provided that the SOP attempts in good faith to obtain satisfactory assurances required in the business associate contracts, and documents the attempt and the reasons that these assurances cannot be obtained. This control helps covered entities to enforce the Minimum Necessary Rule.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    In accordance with federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and/or guidance, the public is not authorized access to nonpublic information (e.g., information protected under the Privacy Act and proprietary information). This control addresses information systems that are controlled by the organization and accessible to the public, typically without identification or authentication. The posting of information on non-CMS information systems is covered by organizational policy.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    A system of records maintaining personally identifiable information (PII) that is not approved for release under the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) is nonpublic information. When agencies consider sharing or posting PII, they must do so in a way that fully protects individual privacy. Under HIPAA, a covered entity or business associate may not use or disclose protected health information except as provided by the HIPAA Privacy Rule. This control implements procedures to protect information, including PII, from being posted publicly improperly.PII that is nonpublic information must not be posted onto a publicly accessible information system.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AT family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Information security awareness and training complements privacy awareness and training efforts, particularly when awareness and training efforts address topics where the two disciplines overlap, such as on topics related to use, confidentiality, access, integrity, and the protection of sensitive information. Coordination between the information security and privacy offices on the proper use and protections to be afforded to personally identifiable information (PII) within security awareness and training policies addresses the purpose, roles and responsibilities surrounding PII compliance.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations determine the appropriate content of security and privacy awareness and training, and security and privacy awareness techniques based on the specific organizational requirements and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. The content must provide a basic understanding of the need for information security and privacy; descriptions of user actions necessary to maintain security and privacy and instruction on how to respond to suspected security and privacy incidents. The content must also provide awareness of the need for operations security and privacy as they relate to CMS's information security and privacy program. Security and privacy awareness techniques may include, for example, displaying posters, offering supplies inscribed with security and privacy reminders, generating email advisories/notices from senior organizational officials, displaying logon screen messages, and conducting information security and privacy awareness events.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Information security awareness and training complements privacy awareness and training efforts, particularly when awareness and training efforts address topics where the two disciplines overlap, such as on topics related to use, confidentiality, access, integrity, and the protection of sensitive information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The following elements of security training are addressable under HIPAA. Security Awareness Training should include:

    (i) periodic security updates;
    (ii) procedures for guarding against, detecting, and reporting malicious software;
    (iii) procedures for monitoring log-in attempts and reporting discrepancies; and
    (iv) procedures for creating, changing, and safeguarding passwords.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations determine the appropriate content of security and privacy training based on the assigned roles and responsibilities of individuals, the specific security requirements of CMS, and the information systems to which personnel have authorized access. In addition, organizations provide enterprise architects, information system developers, software developers, acquisition/procurement officials, information system managers, system/network administrators, personnel conducting configuration management and auditing activities, personnel performing independent verification and validation activities, security control assessors, and other personnel having access to system-level software, adequate security- and privacy-related training specifically tailored for their assigned duties. Comprehensive role-based training addresses management, operational, and technical roles and responsibilities covering physical, personnel, and technical safeguards and countermeasures. Such training can include, for example, training on policies, procedures, tools, and artifacts for the organizational security and privacy roles defined. Organizations also provide the training necessary for individuals to carry out their responsibilities related to operations and supply chain security within the context of CMS's information security and privacy programs. Role-based security and privacy training also applies to contractors providing services to federal agencies.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Significant information security and privacy responsibilities are defined as the responsibilities associated with a given role or position, which, upon execution, could have the potential to adversely impact the security and/or privacy posture of one or more CMS systems.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AU family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system. Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.

    The Federal Rules of Evidence can be found at this website: <http://www.uscourts.gov/file/rules-evidence>

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    This control identifies privacy-relevant security auditable events using a risk-based approach. Examples of privacy-relevant auditable events include logging access to or modification of PII.The parameter values for this control do not provide an exhaustive list of all auditable events, but instead list the auditable events required by OMB privacy policy. The organization should manage the length of time that a log file is maintained to the period necessary to comply with the organization's security and privacy policies.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The HIPAA Security Rule requires the auditing of activity in information systems that contain PHI but does not identify the specific audit events. Follow PII Supplemental Guidance.

Organizations coordinate the selection of required audit content to support the centralized management and configuration capability provided by the information system.Audit records contain evidence that can be used in the investigation of compromised systems. To prevent this evidence from being compromised, it must be sent to a separate system continuously. Methods for sending audit records include, but are not limited to, system audit tools used to send logs directly to another host or through the system's syslog service to another host. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    The organization considers the types of auditing to be performed and the audit processing requirements when allocating audit storage capacity. Allocating sufficient audit storage capacity reduces the likelihood of such capacity being exceeded and resulting in the potential loss or reduction of auditing capability.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Adequate storage capacity for logs used to audit security- and privacy-related controls reduces the likelihood of the logs exceeding available storage space and potentially losing log information or reducing auditing capability. Audit information could be necessary to enforce criminal or civil penalties under the Privacy Act, and providing adequate storage capacity allows for preserving complete audit information for these purposes.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Audit review, analysis, and reporting covers information security-related auditing performed by organizations including, for example, auditing that results from monitoring of account usage, remote access, wireless connectivity, mobile device connection, configuration settings, system component inventory, use of maintenance tools and nonlocal maintenance, physical access, temperature and humidity, equipment delivery and removal, communications at the information system boundaries, use of mobile code, and use of Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP). Findings can be reported to organizational entities that include, for example, incident response team, help desk, information security group/department. If organizations are prohibited from reviewing and analyzing audit information or unable to conduct such activities (e.g., in certain national security applications or systems), the review/analysis may be carried out by other organizations granted such authority.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Periodic reviews and analysis of privacy logs are important for identifying indications of inappropriate or unusual activity that may signify a privacy incident or breach.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control enhancement does not require vulnerability scanning, the generation of performance data, or information system monitoring. Rather, the control enhancement requires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated with the analysis of audit information. Security Event and Information Management System tools can facilitate audit record aggregation/consolidation from multiple information system components as well as audit record correlation and analysis. The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection events with scanning results. Correlation with performance data can help uncover denial of service attacks or cyber-attacks resulting in unauthorized use of resources. Correlation with system monitoring information can assist in uncovering attacks and in better relating audit information to operational situations. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.

    The correlation of physical audit information and audit logs from information systems may assist organizations in identifying examples of suspicious behavior or supporting evidence of such behavior. For example, the correlation of an individual's identity for logical access to certain information systems with the additional physical security information that the individual was present at the facility when the logical access occurred, may prove to be useful in investigations.

    - Cross-organizational coordination leverages critical information from a variety of sources to more effectively respond to information security-related incidents that potentially affect organization operations, assets, and individuals.
    - The correlation of monitoring tools that usually work in isolation (e.g., host monitoring, network monitoring, anti-virus software) can provide an organization-wide view and in so doing, may reveal otherwise unseen attack patterns.
    - Effectiveness of event correlation depends on the quality of the data that goes into it. Organizations should establish logging standards and procedures to ensure that adequate information is collected and that the data is reviewed regularly.

    Audit reduction is a process that manipulates collected audit information and organizes such information in a summary format that is more meaningful to analysts. Audit reduction and report generation capabilities do not always emanate from the same information system or from the same organizational entities conducting auditing activities. Audit reduction capability can include, for example, modern data mining techniques with advanced data filters to identify anomalous behavior in audit records. The report generation capability provided by the information system can generate customizable reports. Time ordering of audit records can be a significant issue if the granularity of the timestamp in the record is insufficient. - Event collection and analysis software can perform event reduction by disregarding data that are not significant to information system security, potentially increasing its efficiency in network and storage resource needs.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    To meet the deadlines associated with reporting loss of sensitive information, such as a breach of personally identifiable information (PII), it is necessary to can summarize audit information and generate customized audit reports.

Audit information could be necessary to enforce criminal or civil penalties under the Privacy Act.In addition to cryptographic mechanisms to protect integrity, the confidentiality of personally identifiable information (PII) may require the use of encryption.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization. However, using cryptographic protection allows the organization to utilize the "Safe Harbor"provision under the Breach Notification Rule. If PHI is encrypted pursuant to the Guidance Specifying the Technologies and Methodologies that Render Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals (74 FR 42740), then no breach notification is required following an impermissible use or disclosure of the information. Therefore, organizations should use cryptographic protections for PHI stored on electronic media.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Individuals with privileged access to an information system and who are also the subject of an audit by that system, may affect the reliability of audit information by inhibiting audit activities or modifying audit records. This control enhancement requires that privileged access be further defined between audit-related privileges and other privileges, thus limiting the users with audit-related privileges.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    When audit information contains personally identifiable information (PII), the requirement for access to that audit information is the same as for access to PII generally. As such, access to PII in audit logs requires a need-to-know and privacy training commensurate with level of responsibility and access. Privileged users must be evaluated to determine if they have such a need-to-know as part of his or her security function.

    Types of individual actions covered by non-repudiation include, for example, creating information, sending and receiving messages, approving information (e.g., indicating concurrence or signing a contract). Non-repudiation protects individuals against later claims by: (i) authors of not having authored documents; (ii) senders of not having transmitted messages; (iii) receivers of not having received messages; or (iv) signatories of not having signed documents. Non-repudiation services can be used to determine if information originated from an individual, or if an individual took specific actions (e.g., sending an email, signing a contract, approving a procurement request) or received specific information. Organizations obtain non-repudiation services by employing various techniques or mechanisms (e.g., digital signatures, digital message receipts).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Because of the distributed nature of the audit information, cross-organization sharing of audit information may be essential for effective analysis of the auditing being performed. For example, the audit records of one organization may not provide sufficient information to determine the appropriate or inappropriate use of organizational information resources by individuals in other organizations. In some instances, only the home organizations of individuals have the appropriate knowledge to make such determinations, thus requiring the sharing of audit information among organizations.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Since an audit log may contain PHI, when audit information is shared between organizations, an agreement addressing the handling, protection, and disclosure of PHI is required.MOUs, memoranda of agreement (MOAs), and other data sharing agreements must address protection of PHI, audit content confidentiality ensuring authorized disclosures, and assurance that sharing agreement define which audit events and results are both captured and shared.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the CA family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The security assessment and authorization policy and procedures should address the strategy for including applicable privacy requirements and controls in the security program and information systems.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations assess security controls in organizational information system and the environments in which those systems operate as part of: (i) initial and ongoing security authorizations; (ii) FISMA annual assessments; (iii) continuous monitoring; and (iv) system development life cycle activities. Security assessments: (i) ensure that information security is built into organizational information systems; (ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; (iii) provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes; and (iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from NIST SP 800-53 Appendix F (main catalog) and NIST SP 800-53 Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by CMS, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives.To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources, including but not limited to: (i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; (ii) continuous monitoring; or (iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness; and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed.After initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations establish the security control selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the security controls within the information system and its environment of operation for assessment. Those security controls that are the most volatile (i.e., controls most affected by ongoing changes to the information system or its environment of operation) or deemed critical to protecting CMS operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation are assessed more frequently in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information system's three-year authorization cycle. The organization can use the current year's assessment results from any of the above sources to meet the FISMA annual assessment requirement if the results are current, valid, and relevant to determining security control effectiveness. Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    This control addresses the process of planning for and executing security assessments, the scope of which should include assessment of applicable privacy requirements.Once the final security assessment is completed, update the associated Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to reflect the results of the security assessment.

        team to assess the security controls in the information system.
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Independent assessors or assessment teams are individuals or groups who conduct impartial assessments of organizational information systems. Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, or management of the organizational information systems under assessment or to the determination of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors should not: (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; (ii) assess their own work; (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or (iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations.AOs determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. AOs also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining whether contracted security assessment services have sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations, for example, when organizations that own the information systems are small or organizational structures require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of system owners; independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes other than direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.

    Organizations may often rely on assessments of specific information systems by other (external) organizations. Utilizing such existing assessments (i.e., reusing existing assessment evidence) can significantly decrease the time and resources required for organizational assessments by limiting the amount of independent assessment activities that organizations need to perform. The factors that organizations may consider in determining whether to accept assessment results from external organizations can vary. Determinations for accepting assessment results can be based on, for example, past assessment experiences one organization has had with another organization, the reputation that organizations have about assessments, the level of detail of supporting assessment documentation provided, or mandates imposed upon organizations by federal legislation, policies, or directives.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control applies to dedicated connections between information systems (i.e., system interconnections) and does not apply to transitory, user-controlled connections such as email and website browsing. Organizations carefully consider the risks that may be introduced when information systems are connected to other systems with different security requirements and security controls, both within organizations and external to organizations. The CMS authorizing official determines the risk associated with information system connections and the appropriate controls employed. If interconnecting systems have the same CMS Authorizing Official, an Interconnection Security Agreement (ISA) or another specific interconnection document (such as MOU/MOA, SLA, or specific contractual clause) is not required. Interface characteristics between the interconnecting information systems can be described in the security plans for their respective systems. Instead of developing an interconnection agreement (or other valid interconnection agreement forms such as MOU/MOA, SLA, etc.), organizations may choose to incorporate this information into formal contracts (so long as the appropriate detail is provided therein), especially if the interconnection is to be established between CMS and a non-federal (private sector) organization. Risk considerations also include information systems sharing the same networks. For certain technologies (e.g., space, unmanned aerial vehicles, and medical devices), there may be specialized connections in place during preoperational testing. Such connections may require interconnection agreements and be subject to additional security controls.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Interconnection agreements document whether and under what circumstances sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), can be shared between information systems in different authorization boundaries (e.g., an interface between systems owned by different agencies) over a dedicated or "always on"connection. Interconnection agreements communicate that sensitive information will be communicated via the connection and define the security parameters required to protect it. Interconnection agreements also provide a record of agreed upon terms and a document against which controls can be enforced and audited. Organizational policy dictates whether interconnection agreements are required for internal connections within an organization.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Consider the need for a MOU/MOA or Business Associate Agreement, and implement as necessary.

    Organizations typically do not have control over external networks (e.g., the Internet). Approved boundary protection devices (e.g., routers, firewalls) mediate communications (i.e., information flows) between unclassified non-national security systems and external networks. This control enhancement is required for organizations processing, storing, or transmitting Controlled Unclassified Information (CUI).

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Security authorizations are official management decisions, conveyed through authorization decision documents, by the CMS CIO or his/her designated representative (i.e., authorizing officials) to authorize operation of information systems and to explicitly accept the risk to CMS operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the implementation of agreed-upon security controls. Explicit authorization to operate the information system is provided by the CMS CIO or his/her designated representative prior to a system being placed into operations. Through the security authorization process, the CMS CIO is accountable for security risks associated with the operation and use of CMS information systems.OMB policy requires that organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing the CMS CIO and information system owners with an up-to-date status of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation. To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, the CMS CIO uses results of the continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    One of the considerations for the "go/no go"decision when authorizing (or re-authorizing) an information system is whether applicable privacy requirements have been met.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The senior-level executive should be one of the following: HIPAA Security Officer, Authorizing Official, Program Manager, Information System Security Manager (ISSM), or Information System Security Officer (ISSO).

    Guidance for systems defined as CSPs:

    Significant change is defined in NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1, Appendix F. The CSP describes the types of changes to the information system or the environment of operations that would require a reauthorization of the information system. The types of changes are approved and accepted by the Joint Authorization Board (JAB).

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Continuous monitoring programs facilitate ongoing awareness of threats, vulnerabilities, and information security to support organizational risk management decisions. The terms "continuous"and "ongoing"imply that organizations assess/analyze security controls and information security-related risks at a frequency sufficient to support organizational risk-based decisions. The results of continuous monitoring programs generate appropriate risk response actions by organizations. Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the security authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions. Automation supports more frequent updates to security authorization packages, hardware/software/firmware inventories, and other system information. Effectiveness is further enhanced when continuous monitoring outputs are formatted to provide information that is specific, measurable, actionable, relevant, and timely. Continuous monitoring activities are scaled in accordance with the security categories of information systems.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The state of security controls can directly correlate to privacy risk. Continuous monitoring supports the identification of issues that could result in unauthorized access to sensitive information such as PII, data quality issues, and other concerns, including privacy, that are supported by security controls.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Consider using automated tools and mechanisms for system activity review. The effectiveness of continuous monitoring of various activities, for example, failed or successful log-ins, inappropriate file access, detecting and reporting on malicious code/viruses through network transmission, is enhanced using approved automated tools.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations can maximize the value of assessments of security controls during the continuous monitoring process by requiring that such assessments be conducted by assessors or assessment teams with appropriate levels of independence based on continuous monitoring strategies. Assessor independence provides a degree of impartiality to the monitoring process. To achieve such impartiality, assessors should not:

    (i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted;
    (ii) assess their own work;
    (iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or
    (iv) place themselves in advocacy positions for the organizations acquiring their services.

    An independent assessor (defined in the RMH, Volume 1, Chapter 10, CMS Risk Management Terms, Definitions, and Acronyms) may be any internal/external agent or team that can conduct an impartial assessment of an organizational information system. Impartiality implies that the assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest with respect to the development, operation, and/or management chain-of-command associated with the information system or to the determination of control effectiveness. Since these determinations are somewhat subjective, the CMS CISO retains the ultimate authority to make final judgments on the independence of any assessor. In addition, see CMS IS2P2 section entitled Risk Management Framework RMF (CMS-RMF-1.8).

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance organizational information systems will have against adversaries within a set of specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of internal and external adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber-attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an information system and can exercise both physical and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example:

    (i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system;
    (ii) pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and
    (iii) testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities.

    All parties agree to the rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration testing rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on the level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing. External penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of external adversaries (outside the security perimeter) in carrying out hostile cyber-attacks against the organization.  Internal penetration testing is performed from inside the system security perimeter. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    When user session information and other PII is captured or recorded during penetration testing, ensure relevant privacy controls are addressed.

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    This control establishes baseline configurations for information systems and system components, including communications and connectivity-related aspects of systems. Baseline configurations are documented, formally reviewed and agreed-upon sets of specifications for information systems or configuration items within those systems. Baseline configurations serve as a basis for future builds, releases, and/or changes to information systems. Baseline configurations include information about information system components (e.g., standard software packages installed on workstations, notebook computers, servers, network components, or mobile devices; current version numbers and patch information on operating systems and applications; and configuration settings/parameters), network topology, and the logical placement of those components within the system architecture. Maintaining baseline configurations requires creating new baselines as organizational information systems change over time. Baseline configurations of information systems reflect the current enterprise architecture.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Establishing separate baseline configurations for development, testing, and operational environments helps protect information systems from unplanned/unexpected events related to development and testing activities. Separate baseline configurations allow organizations to apply the configuration management that is most appropriate for each type of configuration. For example, management of operational configurations typically emphasizes the need for stability, while management of development/test configurations requires greater flexibility. Configurations in the test environment mirror the configurations in the operational environment to the extent practicable so that the results of the testing are representative of the proposed changes to the operational systems. This control enhancement requires separate configurations but not necessarily separate physical environments.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    When it is known that information systems, system components, or devices (e.g., notebook computers, mobile devices) will be in high-risk areas, additional security controls may be implemented to counter the greater threat in such areas coupled with the lack of physical security relative to organizational-controlled areas. For example, organizational policies and procedures for notebook computers used by individuals departing on and returning from travel include, for example, determining which locations are of concern, defining required configurations for the devices, ensuring that the devices are configured as intended before travel is initiated, and applying specific safeguards to the device after travel is completed. Specially configured notebook computers include, for example, computers with sanitized hard drives, limited applications, and additional hardening (e.g., more stringent configuration settings). Specified safeguards applied to mobile devices upon return from travel include, for example, examining the device for signs of physical tampering and purging/reimaging the hard disk drive. Protecting information residing on mobile devices is covered in the Media Protection (MP) family.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Configuration change controls for organizational information systems involve the systematic proposal, justification, implementation, testing, review, and disposition of changes to the systems, including system upgrades and modifications. Configuration change control includes changes to baseline configurations for components and configuration items of information systems, changes to configuration settings for information technology products (e.g., operating systems, applications, firewalls, routers, and mobile devices), unscheduled/unauthorized changes, and changes to remediate vulnerabilities. Typical processes for managing configuration changes to information systems include, for example, Configuration Control Boards that approve proposed changes to systems. For new development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades, organizations consider including representatives from development organizations on the Configuration Control Boards. Auditing of changes includes activities before and after changes are made to organizational information systems and the auditing activities required to implement such changes.

    Changes to information systems include modifications to hardware, software, or firmware components and configuration settings defined in CM 6. Organizations ensure that testing does not interfere with information system operations. Individuals/groups conducting tests understand organizational security policies and procedures, information system security policies and procedures, and the specific health, safety, and environmental risks associated with facilities/processes. Operational systems may need to be taken off-line, or replicated to the extent feasible, before testing can be conducted. If information systems must be taken off-line for testing, the tests are scheduled to occur during planned system outages whenever possible. If testing cannot be conducted on operational systems, organizations employ compensating controls (e.g., testing on replicated systems). - To better secure IT infrastructure, configuration management procedure should include use of a security configuration checklist (sometimes called a lockdown, hardening guide, or benchmark) to help configure systems to an operating environment. - Security authorization (authorization to operate given identified risk and security controls) is maintained when proposed or actual changes to the information system, and their suspected impact on the security of the system, are documented and continuously monitored for compliance. - Configuration Management process includes the following steps:

    1. Identify change;
    2. "Evaluate change request;
    3. Approve, Deny or Defer implementation of the change;
    4. Implement the approved change; and
    5. Continuously monitor change for acceptable operation.

Individuals conducting security impact analyses possess the necessary skills/technical expertise to analyze the changes to information systems and the associated security ramifications. Security impact analysis may include, for example, reviewing security plans to understand security control requirements and reviewing system design documentation to understand control implementation and how specific changes might affect the controls. Security impact analyses may also include assessments of risk to better understand the impact of the changes and to determine if additional security controls are required. Security impact analyses are scaled in accordance with the security categories of the information systems.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    When analyzing changes to the information system, the impacts to privacy are also considered. If necessary, conduct a privacy impact assessment.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Separate test environment in this context means an environment that is physically or logically isolated and distinct from the operational environment. The separation is sufficient to ensure that activities in the test environment do not impact activities in the operational environment, and information in the operational environment is not inadvertently transmitted to the test environment. Separate environments can be achieved by physical or logical means. If physically separate test environments are not used, organizations determine the strength of mechanism required when implementing logical separation (e.g., separation achieved through virtual machines).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    If personally identifiable information (PII) is used in the test environment, then the same controls required for systems containing PII must be applied to the test environment. Simulated PII information should be used to the maximum extent practicable when testing system functionality.

Organizations maintain records of access to ensure that configuration change control is implemented and to support after-the-fact actions should organizations discover any unauthorized changes. Access restrictions for change also include software libraries. Access restrictions include, for example, physical and logical access controls (see AC-3 and PE-3), workflow automation, media libraries, abstract layers (e.g., changes implemented into third-party interfaces rather than directly into information systems), and change windows (e.g., changes occur only during specified times, making unauthorized changes easy to discover).

Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: (i) registry settings; (ii) account, file, and directory permission settings; and (iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The established settings become part of each system's baseline configuration.Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the USGCB which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM 7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration requirements for federal information systems.Legacy operating systems without ongoing vendor support, such as Windows XP or older desktop OS, Windows Server 2003 or older server OS, Solaris 9 or older OS, or Red Hat Linux 9 or older, are only permissible if documented within the Risk Assessment and System Security Plan and authorized by the Authorizing Official (AO).

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information systems can provide a wide variety of functions and services. Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., VoIP, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., USB, FTP, and Hypertext Transfer Protocol [HTTP]) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.

    Per NIST SP 800-53r4, this control may be used in place of CM-7(4), Unauthorized Software/Blacklisting.  Control enhancement CM-7(5) is only required for systems categorized under FIPS-199 as HIGH. Implementation of whitelisting is an option for all systems (e.g., to include any system categorized under FIPS-199 as MODERATE and LOW). If the system owner/business owner chooses to implement CM-7(5) on systems categorized under FIPS-199 as MODERATE and LOW, CM-7(4) does not have to be implemented.The process used to identify software programs that are authorized to execute on organizational information systems is commonly referred to as whitelisting. In addition to whitelisting, organizations consider verifying the integrity of white-listed software programs using, for example, cryptographic checksums, digital signatures, or hash functions. Verification of white-listed software can occur either prior to execution or at system startup. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations may choose to implement centralized information system component inventories that include components from all organizational information systems. In such situations, organizations ensure that the resulting inventories include system-specific information required for proper component accountability (e.g., information system association, information system owner). Information deemed necessary for effective accountability of information system components includes, for example, hardware inventory specifications, software license information, software version numbers, component owners, and for networked components or devices, machine names and network addresses. Inventory specifications include, for example, manufacturer, device type, model, serial number, and physical location. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.

    Guidance for systems defined as CSPs:

    Information deemed necessary to achieve effective property accountability may include hardware inventory specifications (manufacturer, type, model, serial number, physical location), software license information, information system/component owner, and for a networked component/device, the machine name and network address.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Identifying any changes or updates to system inventories allows organizations to accurately track the equipment on which their information systems are run and to maintain an accurate inventory of hardware and software used to collect and manage PHI. Maintaining a current inventory supports accountability controls and may also support breach response efforts.

    Guidance for systems defined as CSPs:

    In many organizations, information systems support multiple core missions/business functions. Limiting privileges to change information system components with respect to operational systems is necessary because changes to an information system component may have far-reaching effects on mission/business processes supported by the system where the component resides. The complex, many-to-many relationships between systems and mission/business processes are in some cases, unknown to developers.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Configuration management plans satisfy the requirements in configuration management policies while being tailored to individual information systems. Such plans define detailed processes and procedures for how configuration management is used to support system development life cycle activities at the information system level. Configuration management plans are typically developed during the development/acquisition phase of the system development life cycle. The plans describe how to move changes through change management processes, how to update configuration settings and baseline configurations, how to maintain information system component inventories, how to control development, test, and operational environments, and how to develop, release, and update key documents. Organizations can employ templates to help ensure consistent and timely development and implementation of configuration management plans. Such templates can represent a master configuration management plan for the organization at large with subsets of the plan implemented on a system by system basis. Configuration management approval processes include designation of key management stakeholders responsible for reviewing and approving proposed changes to information systems, and personnel that conduct security impact analyses prior to the implementation of changes to the systems. Configuration items are the information system items (hardware, software, firmware, and documentation) to be configuration-managed. As information systems continue through the system development life cycle, new configuration items may be identified and some existing configuration items may no longer need to be under configuration control.

The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Contingency planning for information systems is part of an overall organizational program for achieving continuity of operations for mission/business functions. Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business processes when systems are impacted.  The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Contingency plans must take privacy-applicable requirements into account so that executing contingency measures does not result in avoidable privacy incidents and breaches.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The contingency plan for systems containing PHI must include:

    1)    Data backup plan,
    2)    Disaster recovery plan,
    3)    Emergency mode operation plan, and
    4)    Emergency access procedures.

    Additionally, the decision to include the following is dependent on a risk analysis to determine if or to what extent these should be included in the contingency plan:
    1)    Testing and revision procedures,
    2)    Applications and data criticality analysis, and
    3)    Contingency operations (i.e., procedures that allow facility access in support of restoration of lost data.

    System-level information includes, for example, system-state information, operating system and application software, and licenses. User-level information includes any information other than system-level information. Mechanisms employed by organizations to protect the integrity of information system backups include, for example, digital signatures and cryptographic hashes. Protection of system backup information while in transit is beyond the scope of this control. Information system backups reflect the requirements in contingency plans as well as other organizational requirements for backing up information.The transfer rate of backup information to an alternate storage site (if so designated) is guided by the CMS recovery time objectives and recovery point objectives. Checkpoint capabilities are part of any backup operation that updates files and consumes large amounts of information system time.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Backup copies of information need to be protected with the same level of security as if that information were being maintained on the original information system. Applicable controls necessary to achieve this and to protect confidentiality include encryption of the backup. Backing up information helps maintain the integrity of the data—a requirement of the Privacy Act and HIPAA.

    Recovery is executing information system contingency plan activities to restore CMS missions/business functions. Reconstitution takes place following recovery and includes activities for returning organizational information systems to fully operational states. Recovery and reconstitution operations reflect mission and business priorities, recovery point/time and reconstitution objectives, and established organizational metrics consistent with contingency plan requirements. Reconstitution includes the deactivation of any interim information system capabilities that may have been needed during recovery operations. Reconstitution also includes assessments of fully restored information system capabilities, reestablishment of continuous monitoring activities, potential information system reauthorizations, and activities to prepare the systems against future disruptions, compromises, or failures. Recovery/reconstitution capabilities employed by organizations can include both automated mechanisms and manual procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Information system recovery and reconstitution is an important step to restoring sensitive information, such as both personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI), to an accurate state following execution of a contingency plan.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizational users include employees or individuals that organizations deem to have equivalent status of employees (e.g., contractors, guest researchers). This control applies to all accesses other than: (i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC-14; and (ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted VPNs for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network.Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: (i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); (ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or (iii) something you are (e.g., a biometric identifier). Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government PIV card and the Department of Defense (DoD) common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Implementing this control ensures unique identification of an individual's account, preventing anonymous access to sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) and providing appropriate access (e.g., where there is a need for the PII in the performance of the user's official duties) for organizational users.

    Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. Factors are defined as follows: something you know, for example, a password or personal identification number (PIN); something you have, for example, a physical authenticator or cryptographic identification device; or something you are, for example, a biometric. Multifactor solutions that feature physical authenticators include, for example, hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD common access card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level (i.e., at logon), organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their discretion, to provide increased information security. Regardless of the type of access (i.e., local, network, or remote) privileged accounts are always authenticated using multifactor options appropriate for the level of risk. Organizations can add additional security measures, such as additional or more rigorous authentication mechanisms, for specific types of access.Authentication mechanisms must comply with the RMH, Volume III, Standard 3.1, CMS Authentication Standards.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizational devices requiring unique device-to-device identification and authentication may be defined by type, by device, or by a combination of type/device. Information systems typically use either shared known information (e.g., Media Access Control [MAC] or TCP/IP addresses) for device identification or organizational authentication solutions (e.g., IEEE 802.1x and Extensible Authentication Protocol [EAP], Radius server with EAP-Transport Layer Security [TLS] authentication, Kerberos) to identify/authenticate devices on local and/or wide area networks. Organizations determine the required strength of authentication mechanisms by the security categories of information systems. Because of the challenges of applying this control on large scale, organizations are encouraged to only apply the control to those limited number (and type) of devices that truly need to support this capability.Note: At a minimum, CMS information systems should be filtered by MAC and/or IP address when accessing remote systems.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Implementing this control ensures that un-authenticated devices, e.g., mobile devices and personal laptop computers, are not able to make a connection to an information system containing PHI. HIPAA requires technical policies and procedures for systems that maintain PHI to allow access only to those persons or software programs that have been granted access rights.

    Common device identifiers include, for example, media access control (MAC), Internet protocol (IP) addresses, or device-unique token identifiers.

Preventing reuse of identifiers implies preventing the assignment of previously used individual, group, role, or device identifiers to different individuals, groups, roles, or devices.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Identifiers are a critical and necessary function to confirm which people and devices are accessing sensitive information such as PII. Using SSNs as identifiers may create the potential for unauthorized disclosure of the SSN and linkage of that individual to other PII, as system identifiers are not protected with the same level of security as are database elements or passwords. In addition, collecting an individual's SSN may create notice requirements under the Privacy Act.

    Identifier management must ensure that any access to, or action involving, PHI is attributable to a unique individual.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Individual authenticators include, for example, passwords, tokens, biometrics, PKI certificates, and key cards. Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.

    Adequate security to ensure confidentiality for an information system containing sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) is achieved through the management of the authenticators permitting access to that system. Authenticator management includes periodically changing passwords or other identifiers (e.g., certification and signatures) to reinforce identity validation and adherence to administrative security policies as well as enforces a time-based restriction on access, all of which bound access to PII in some way, limiting exposure in the event a user account is compromised.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization.

    This control enhancement applies to single-factor authentication of individuals using passwords as individual or group authenticators, and in a similar manner, when passwords are part of multifactor authenticators. This control enhancement does not apply when passwords are used to unlock hardware authenticators (e.g., PIV cards). The implementation of such password mechanisms may not meet all the requirements in the control enhancement. Encrypted representations of passwords include, for example, encrypted versions of passwords and one-way cryptographic hashes of passwords. The number of changed characters refers to the number of changes required with respect to the total number of positions in the current password. Password lifetime restrictions do not apply to temporary passwords.Mobile devices are excluded from the password complexity requirement.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    The feedback from information systems does not provide information that would allow unauthorized individuals to compromise authentication mechanisms. For some types of information systems or system components, for example, desktops/notebooks with relatively large monitors, the threat (often referred to as shoulder surfing) may be significant. For other types of systems or components, for example, mobile devices with 2-4 inch screens, this threat may be less significant, and may need to be balanced against the increased likelihood of typographic input errors due to the small keyboards. Therefore, the means for obscuring the authenticator feedback is selected accordingly. Obscuring the feedback of authentication information includes, for example, displaying asterisks when users type passwords into input devices, or displaying feedback for a very limited time before fully obscuring it.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Restricting feedback from the authentication process limits ability of unauthorized users to compromise the authentication mechanisms for accounts that can access PHI.Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Non-organizational users include information system users other than organizational users explicitly covered by IA 2. These individuals are uniquely identified and authenticated for accesses other than those accesses explicitly identified and documented in AC-14. In accordance with the E-Authentication E-Government initiative, authentication of non-organizational users accessing federal information systems may be required to protect federal, proprietary, or privacy-related information (with exceptions noted for national security systems). Organizations use risk assessments to determine authentication needs and consider scalability, practicality, and security in balancing the need to ensure ease of use for access to federal information and information systems with the need to protect and adequately mitigate risk. IA-2 addresses identification and authentication requirements for access to information systems by organizational users.If E-Authentication is used, refer to Risk Management Handbook (RMH), Volume III, Standard 3.1, CMS Authentication Standards.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the IR family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    In developing incident response policy and procedures, ensure those policies and procedures incorporates guidance from the privacy office for the handling of incidents involving personally identifiable information (PII).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    In developing incident response policy and procedures, ensure those policies and procedures incorporates guidance from the privacy office for the handling of incidents involving PHI.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Incident response training provided by organizations is linked to the assigned roles and responsibilities of organizational personnel to ensure the appropriate content and level of detail is included in such training. For example, regular users may only need to know who to call or how to recognize an incident on the information system; system administrators may require additional training on how to handle/remediate incidents; and incident responders may receive more specific training on forensics, reporting, system recovery, and restoration. Incident response training includes user training in the identification and reporting of suspicious activities, both from external and internal sources.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Those responsible for identifying and responding to a security incident must understand how to recognize when sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI) is involved so that they can coordinate with the designated (e.g., privacy) official.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations test incident response capabilities to determine the overall effectiveness of its capabilities and to identify potential weaknesses or deficiencies. Incident response testing includes, for example, the use of checklists, walk-through or tabletop exercises, simulations (parallel/full interrupt), and comprehensive exercises. Incident response testing can also include a determination of the effects on organizational operations (e.g., reduction in mission capabilities), organizational assets, and individuals, due to the incident response activities themselves. In other words: an institution's resources may be consumed and depleted both directly by an incident, and by its need to allocate resources to address the incident.If the organization routinely responds to incidents, and follows the documented incident response plan to do so, then full-scale simulations (or "table-top exercises") might not be necessary, especially if the documentation produced from the incident response is sufficient to provide a thorough understanding of the breadth and depth of the organization's analysis and response to the incident (including lessons learned). However, it is often the case that responses to incidents do not exercise the full incident response plan (for example, an incident might not meet the documented threshold requiring the organization to alert the media about the incident).  If the organization uses a historic response to an incident as the basis for the annual incident response capability test, any parts of the incident response capability that were not exercised in the historic response must be tested (either via actual exercises or through simulation) and documented as part of the capability test.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations recognize that incident response capability is dependent on the capabilities of organizational information systems and the mission/business processes being supported by those systems. Therefore, organizations consider incident response as part of the definition, design, and development of mission/business processes and information systems. Incident-related information can be obtained from a variety of sources, including, for example, audit monitoring, network monitoring, physical access monitoring, user/administrator reports, and reported supply chain events. Effective incident handling capability includes coordination among many organizational entities, including, for example, mission/business owners, information system owners, authorizing officials, human resources offices, physical and personnel security offices, legal departments, operations personnel, procurement offices, and the risk executive (function).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    A strategic, well-thought-out security incident response program will integrate with privacy incident and breach response where appropriate, with the two processes being mutually supportive.

    Classes of incidents include, for example, malfunctions due to design/implementation errors and omissions, targeted malicious attacks, and untargeted malicious attacks. Appropriate incident response actions include, for example, graceful degradation, system shutdown, fall back to manual mode/alternative technology whereby the system operates differently, employing deceptive measures, alternate information flows, or operating in a mode that is reserved solely for when systems are under attack.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    HIPAA requires administrative, physical and technical safeguards for the protection and access of PHI during an emergency or other occurrence.Organizations establish policies and procedures for responding to an emergency or other occurrence (for example, fire, vandalism, system failure, and natural disaster) that damages systems that contain PHI including procedures to enable continuation of critical business processes for the protection of PHI and for obtaining necessary PHI during an emergency. Additionally, HIPAA requires organizations to conduct a risk analysis to determine whether and to what extent they establish procedures that allow facility access in support of restoration of lost data under the disaster recovery plan in the event of an emergency.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information spillage refers to instances where either classified or sensitive information is inadvertently placed on information systems that are not authorized to process such information. Such information spills often occur when information that is initially thought to be of lower sensitivity is transmitted to an information system and then is subsequently determined to be of higher sensitivity. At that point, corrective action is required. The nature of the organizational response is generally based upon the degree of sensitivity of the spilled information (e.g., security category or classification level), the security capabilities of the information system, the specific nature of contaminated storage media, and the access authorizations (e.g., security clearances) of individuals with authorized access to the contaminated system. The methods used to communicate information about the spill after the fact do not involve methods directly associated with the actual spill to minimize the risk of further spreading the contamination before such contamination is isolated and eradicated.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Having an integrated team for incident response facilitates information sharing. Such capability allows organizational personnel, including developers, implementers, and operators, to leverage the team knowledge of the threat to implement defensive measures that will enable organizations to deter intrusions more effectively. Moreover, it promotes the rapid detection of intrusions, development of appropriate mitigations, and the deployment of effective defensive measures. For example, when an intrusion is detected, the integrated security analysis team can rapidly develop an appropriate response for operators to implement, correlate the new incident with information on past intrusions, and augment ongoing intelligence development. This enables the team to identify adversary TTPs that are linked to the operations tempo or to specific missions/business functions, and to define responsive actions in a way that does not disrupt the mission/business operations. Ideally, information security analysis teams are distributed within organizations to make the capability more resilient.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The integrated information security analysis team will support the organization's personally identifiable information (PII) incident response team (as specified in OMB M-17-12) in all aspects of response to a security incident involving PII.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the MA family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Privacy considerations should be included in system maintenance policy and procedures especially when the system contains information subject to the Privacy Act and/or HIPAA.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Procedures to facilitate the implementation of the system maintenance policy should include access control validation and accountability procedures.

    This control addresses the information security aspects of the information system maintenance program and applies to all types of maintenance to any system component (including applications) conducted by any local or nonlocal entity (e.g., in-contract, warranty, in-house, software maintenance agreement). System maintenance also includes those components not directly associated with information processing and/or data/information retention such as scanners, copiers, and printers. Information necessary for creating effective maintenance records includes, for example:  (i) Date and time of maintenance;  (ii) Name of individuals or group performing the maintenance;  (iii) Name of escort, if necessary;  (iv) Description of the maintenance performed; and  (v) Information system components/equipment removed or replaced (including identification numbers, if applicable). The level of detail included in maintenance records can be informed by the security categories of organizational information systems. Organizations consider supply chain issues associated with replacement components for information systems.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    HIPAA requires organizations to apply reasonable and appropriate safeguards for the protection of PHI, including implementing policies and procedures to document repairs and modifications to the facility which are related to security.Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities conducted by individuals communicating through a network, either an external network (e.g., the Internet) or an internal network. Local maintenance and diagnostic activities are those activities carried out by individuals physically present at the information system or information system component and not communicating across a network connection. Authentication techniques used in the establishment of nonlocal maintenance and diagnostic sessions reflect the network access requirements in IA  2. Typically, strong authentication requires authenticators that are resistant to replay attacks and employ multifactor authentication. Strong authenticators include, for example, PKI where certificates are stored on a token protected by a password, passphrase, or biometric. Enforcing requirements in MA-4 is accomplished in part by other controls.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control applies to individuals performing hardware or software maintenance on organizational information systems, while PE-2 addresses physical access for individuals whose maintenance duties place them within the physical protection perimeter of the systems (e.g., custodial staff, physical plant maintenance personnel). Technical competence of supervising individuals relates to the maintenance performed on the information systems, while having required access authorizations refers to maintenance on and near the systems. Individuals not previously identified as authorized maintenance personnel, such as information technology manufacturers, vendors, system integrators, and consultants, may require privileged access to organizational information systems, for example, when required to conduct maintenance activities with little or no notice. Based on organizational assessments of risk, organizations may issue temporary credentials to these individuals. Temporary credentials may be for one-time use or for very limited time periods.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    If maintenance personnel are contractors, then the organizations personnel responsible for contracting (such as the contracting officer [KO or CO], contracting officer's representative [COR], or contracting officer's technical representative [COTR]) or the program manager must ensure that contractors having access to records (i.e., files or data) from a system of records are contractually bound to be covered by the Privacy Act.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification.

    Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Restricting non-digital media access includes, for example, denying access to patient medical records in a community hospital unless the individuals seeking access to such records are authorized healthcare providers. Restricting access to digital media includes, for example, limiting access to design specifications stored on compact disks in the media library to the project leader and the individuals on the development team.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Restricting access to digital and non-digital media, including mobile devices with storage capabilities, protects sensitive information, such as PII, from unauthorized use and disclosure. A risk assessment should be conducted to determine what sensitive information if any, can be stored on certain media types and who is authorized to do so.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    The term security marking refers to the application/use of human-readable security attributes. The term security labeling refers to the application/use of security attributes regarding internal data structures within information systems (see AC-16). Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Security marking is generally not required for media containing information determined by organizations to be in the public domain or to be publicly releasable. However, some organizations may require markings for public information indicating that the information is publicly releasable. Marking of information system media reflects applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. Physically controlling information system media includes, for example, conducting inventories, ensuring procedures are in place to allow individuals to check out and return media to a media library, and maintaining accountability for all stored media. Secure storage includes, for example, a locked drawer, desk, or cabinet, or a controlled media library. The type of media storage is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information residing on the media. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical and procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information systems. For media containing information determined by organizations to be in the public domain, to be publicly releasable, or to have limited or no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if accessed by other than authorized personnel, fewer safeguards may be needed. In these situations, physical access controls provide adequate protection. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Controlling the storage of media containing sensitive information such as PII protects the media from theft and promotes accountability.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information systems.Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example, restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport as part of an overall system of transport-related records.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Protecting and controlling media containing sensitive information, such as PII, commensurate with the sensitivity of the information contained on the media, during transport outside of controlled areas, promotes accountability and limits situations that make the media vulnerable to unauthorized use and disclosure through loss, theft, or other mishandling.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization. However, using cryptographic protection allows the organization to utilize the "Safe Harbor"provision under the Breach Notification Rule.  If PHI is encrypted pursuant to the Guidance Specifying the Technologies and Methodologies that Render Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals (45 C.F.R.  Part 164 Subpart D), then no breach notification is required following an impermissible disclosure of the information. Therefore, organizations should use cryptographic protections for PHI stored on electronic media if they wish to take advantage of the Safe Harbor provision.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control applies to all information system media, both digital and non-digital, subject to disposal or reuse, whether the media is considered removable. Examples include media found in scanners, copiers, printers, notebook computers, workstations, network components, and mobile devices. The sanitization process removes information from the media such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Sanitization techniques, including clearing, purging, cryptographic erase, and destruction, prevent the disclosure of information to unauthorized individuals when such media is reused or released for disposal. Organizations determine the appropriate sanitization methods recognizing that destruction is sometimes necessary when other methods cannot be applied to media requiring sanitization. Organizations use discretion on the employment of approved sanitization techniques and procedures for media containing information deemed to be in the public domain or publicly releasable, or deemed to have no adverse impact on organizations or individuals if released for reuse or disposal. Sanitization of non-digital media includes, for example, removing a classified appendix from an otherwise unclassified document, or redacting selected sections or words from a document by obscuring the redacted sections/words in a manner equivalent in effectiveness to removing them from the document. NSA standards and policies control the sanitization process for media containing classified information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Properly sanitizing media that contains sensitive information, such as PII, prior to disposal or release protects the information from unauthorized use and disclosure.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system media includes both digital and non-digital media. Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers). In contrast to MP-2, which restricts user access to media, this control restricts the use of certain types of media on information systems, for example, restricting/prohibiting the use of flash drives or external hard disk drives. Organizations can employ technical and nontechnical safeguards (e.g., policies, procedures, rules of behavior) to restrict the use of information system media. Organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices, for example, by using physical cages on workstations to prohibit access to certain external ports, or disabling/removing the ability to insert, read or write to such devices. Organizations may also limit the use of portable storage devices to only approved devices including, for example, devices provided by the organization, devices provided by other approved organizations, and devices that are not personally owned. Finally, organizations may restrict the use of portable storage devices based on the type of device, for example, prohibiting the use of writeable, portable storage devices, and implementing this restriction by disabling or removing the capability to write to such devices.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    This control applies to devices containing PII, particularly portable storage and mobile devices.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control applies to all information system media, digital and non-digital, subject to release outside of the organization, whether the media is considered removable. The downgrading process, when applied to system media, removes information from the media, typically by security category or classification level, such that the information cannot be retrieved or reconstructed. Downgrading of media includes redacting information to enable wider release and distribution. Downgrading of media also ensures that empty space on the media (e.g., slack space within files) is devoid of information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Prior to downgrading any media containing sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII) or protected health information (PHI), that media must be reviewed to ensure that all sensitive information has been appropriately redacted or de-identified and any file containing sensitive information on that media is appropriately sanitized so that the information is not recoverable or re-identifiable.

    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PE family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Sensitivity of PHI may impact the necessary physical and environmental controls. Physical controls are important for protecting PHI against unauthorized access, use, and disclosure. Environmental controls can be critical when PHI has high availability requirements (e.g., core mission capabilities of an organization rely on consistent and frequent access to PHI).

This control only applies to areas within facilities that have not been designated as publicly accessible.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization. Maintaining a current list of personnel that are authorized to access facilities where sensitive information is located protects the information from unauthorized access. For the purposes of this control, "sensitive information"includes personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control applies to organizational employees and visitors. Individuals (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Organizations determine the types of facility guards needed, including, for example, professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or information system users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras, monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system components in secured areas. Physical access control systems comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Program provides implementation guidance for identity, credential, and access management capabilities for physical access control systems. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to information systems and/or components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of organizational information systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access to such devices.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Employing physical access controls that limit access to a facility that are commensurate with the level of sensitivity of the information processed in a facility protects the information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Physical security safeguards applied to information system distribution and transmission lines help to prevent accidental damage, disruption, and physical tampering. In addition, physical safeguards may be necessary to help prevent eavesdropping or in-transit modification of unencrypted transmissions. Security safeguards to control physical access to system distribution and transmission lines include, for example:

    (i) locked wiring closets;
    (ii) disconnected or locked spare jacks; and/or
    (iii) protection of cabling by conduit or cable trays.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Protecting physical access to transmission medium protects the confidentiality of PHI by protecting it from eavesdropping, the integrity of PHI by protecting it from modification (when unencrypted), and protects the availability of PHI by helping to prevent accidental or intentional damage or disruption to transmission lines.Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Physical and environmental hazards include, for example, flooding, fire, tornados, earthquakes, hurricanes, acts of terrorism, vandalism, electromagnetic pulse, electrical interference, and other forms of incoming electromagnetic radiation. In addition, organizations consider the location of physical entry points where unauthorized individuals, while not being granted access, might nonetheless be near information systems and therefore increase the potential for unauthorized access to organizational communications (e.g., using wireless sniffers or microphones).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    This control is required to limit intentional and unintentional disclosures of personally identifiable information (PII). One example of positioning information system components to minimize the opportunity for unauthorized access would be ensuring that monitors are placed in such a way as to prevent unauthorized viewing. An example of positioning information system components to minimize potential damage from physical land environmental hazards would be to place servers and disk arrays in locations that are secured.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the PL family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Security plans relate security requirements to a set of security controls and control enhancements. Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and control enhancements meet those security requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in NIST 800-53 Appendix D and Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). NIST 800-53 Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays.Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by reference sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.All CMS information systems and major applications are covered by a security plan, which is compliant with current CMS procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The SSP is necessary for the information system to be authorized. As the security controls section of a privacy impact assessment or other privacy documentation may not provide sufficient details to determine which controls have been implemented, the SSP and plan of action and milestones (POA&M, see PM-4) are the best locations to address privacy related security controls.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses actions taken by organizations in the design and development of information systems. The information security architecture at the individual information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and any other specific protection needs.In today's modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers (to include CSPs). Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of information systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organization's enterprise architecture and information security architecture.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The information security architecture identifies security and privacy controls necessary to support privacy requirements. The SAOP or CPO are the best resource for identifying privacy requirements and privacy controls.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Access to sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI), requires both a valid need to know as documented by an access authorization request, and requires a background investigation (or appropriate screening) to ensure the individual being provided access is suitable.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system-related property includes, for example, hardware authentication tokens, system administration technical manuals, keys, identification cards, and building passes. Exit interviews ensure that terminated individuals understand the security constraints imposed by being former employees and that proper accountability is achieved for information system-related property. Security topics of interest at exit interviews can include, for example, reminding terminated individuals of nondisclosure agreements and potential limitations on future employment. Exit interviews may not be possible for some terminated individuals, for example, in cases related to job abandonment, illnesses, and non-availability of supervisors. Exit interviews are important for individuals with security clearances. Timely execution of termination actions is essential for individuals terminated for cause. In certain situations, organizations consider disabling the information system accounts of individuals that are being terminated prior to the individuals being notified.Appropriate personnel have access to official records created by terminated employees that are stored on information systems.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control applies when reassignments or transfers of individuals are permanent or of such extended durations as to make the actions warranted. Organizations define actions appropriate for the types of reassignments or transfers, whether permanent or extended. Actions that may be required for personnel transfers or reassignments to other positions within organizations include, for example: (i) Returning old and issuing new keys, identification cards, and building passes; (ii) Closing information system accounts and establishing new accounts; (iii) Changing information system access authorizations (i.e., privileges); and (iv) Providing for access to official records to which individuals had access at previous work locations and in previous information system accounts.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    When personnel are reassigned or transferred, their access to sensitive information, such as PII, must be reviewed to determine whether and how their access permissions should change.

    Access agreements include, for example, nondisclosure agreements, acceptable use agreements, rules of behavior, and conflict-of-interest agreements. Signed access agreements include an acknowledgement that individuals have read, understand, and agree to abide by the constraints associated with organizational information systems to which access is authorized. Organizations can use electronic signatures to acknowledge access agreements unless specifically prohibited by organizational policy.The HHS RoB is the standard HHS access agreement. All new users of HHS, including CMS, information resources must read the HHS RoB and sign the accompanying acknowledgement form before accessing Department data or other information, systems, and/or networks. This acknowledgement must be completed every 365 days thereafter, which may be done as part of annual the organization Information Systems Security Awareness Training (see AT-3).

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Third-party providers include, for example, service bureaus, contractors, and other organizations providing information system development, information technology services, outsourced applications, and network and security management. Organizations explicitly include personnel security requirements in acquisition-related documents. Third-party providers may have personnel working at organizational facilities with credentials, badges, or information system privileges issued by organizations. Notifications of third-party personnel changes ensure appropriate termination of privileges and credentials. Organizations define the transfers and terminations deemed reportable by security-related characteristics that include, for example, functions, roles, and nature of credentials/privileges associated with individuals transferred or terminated.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    This control ensures that third-party service providers (to include CSPs) that will have access to sensitive information, such as personally identifiable information (PII), are held accountable in the same way the organizational personnel are held accountable.

Sanctions processes are described in access agreements and can be included as part of general personnel policies and procedures for organizations. Organizations consult with the Office of General Counsel regarding matters of employee sanctions.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    If the personnel sanctions are associated with the loss, theft, or compromise of personally identifiable information (PII), additional care must be taken to prevent further privacy incidents. When providing notice of sanctions, do not provide the PII involved in the incident to anyone without an explicit need to know. Unless the individual needs the specific PII elements breached to perform their job function, the individual does not need to know the PII. Instead, provide characterization of the type(s) of PII breached (e.g., provide "Full Name"instead of providing "John Doe,"or "Blood Type"instead of "A positive").

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the RA family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The Privacy Office (Senior Official for Privacy) should be consulted when developing risk assessment policy and procedures to cover information systems containing PII.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective security categorization decisions. Security categories describe the potential adverse impacts to organizational operations, organizational assets, and individuals if organizational information and information systems are comprised through a loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Organizations conduct the security categorization process as an organization-wide activity with the involvement of chief information officers, senior information security officers, information system owners, mission/business owners, and information owners/stewards. Organizations also consider the potential adverse impacts to other organizations and, in accordance with the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 and Homeland Security Presidential Directives (HSPD), potential national-level adverse impacts. Security categorization processes carried out by organizations facilitate the development of inventories of information assets, and along with CM-8, mappings to specific information system components where information is processed, stored, or transmitted.All CMS information systems categorized as High or Moderate are considered sensitive or contain sensitive information. All CMS information systems categorized as Low are considered non-sensitive or contain non-sensitive information. Organizations implement the minimum-security requirements and controls as established in the current CMS Information Security ARS Standard, based on the system security categorization.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    A determination of security categorization is based in part on whether the information is PII, or the system contains sensitive information such as PII, and is a fundamental determination for implementing security controls.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Clearly defined authorization boundaries are a prerequisite for effective risk assessments. Risk assessments consider threats, vulnerabilities, likelihood, and impact to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation based on the operation and use of information systems. Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access to federal information systems.Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security control selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls to complete the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control supplementation.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    A standardized risk assessment process should include a consideration of risks associated with the collection, maintenance, and use of sensitive information such as PII. Effective implementation of privacy risk management processes requires both organizational and information system processes across the life cycle of the mission, business processes, and information system. An evaluation of privacy risk for an information system benefits an organization and the individuals whose PII are included by enabling the organization to identify, evaluate, and manage the privacy risks for the information in that system. The content of the privacy risk assessment performed under this control should be addressed in concert with the privacy risk evaluation conducted through the internal risk management process to ensure privacy risks are identified, evaluated, and managed in information systems containing privacy-related sensitive information. A standardized risk assessment process should include a consideration of risks associated with the collection, maintenance, and use of sensitive information such as PII. An evaluation of risks associated with the potential impact of loss of the PII must be identified within the overall risk assessment. All risk assessment documentation must reflect these findings.Effective implementation of privacy risk management processes requires both organizational and information system processes across the life cycle of the mission, business processes, and information system.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Security categorization of information systems guides the frequency and comprehensiveness of vulnerability scans. Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example:

    (i) scanning for patch levels;
    (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and
    (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.

    Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).The organization remediates vulnerabilities based on the Business Owner's risk prioritization in accordance with the guidance defined under security control SI-02.Penetration testing is covered under CA-08. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats.

The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    A well-defined system development life cycle provides the foundation for the successful development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems. To apply the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components (including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security architects, security engineers, and information system security officers in system development life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated into organizational information systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the development team that possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    To ensure that privacy and security controls are appropriately considered during each phase of the SDLC, both the security and privacy offices should have a clear understanding of the requirements to protect PII. The privacy office should participate throughout the SDLC.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system components are discrete, identifiable information technology assets (e.g., hardware, software, or firmware) that represent the building blocks of an information system. Information system components include commercial information technology products. Security functional requirements include security capabilities, security functions, and security mechanisms. Security strength requirements associated with such capabilities, functions, and mechanisms include requirements for degree of correctness, completeness, resistance to direct attack, and resistance to tampering or bypass. Security assurance requirements include:   (i) Development processes, procedures, practices, and methodologies; and   (ii) Evidence from development and assessment activities providing grounds for confidence that the required security functionality has been implemented and the required security strength has been achieved. Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values using assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services. Acceptance criteria for information systems, information system components, and information system services are defined in the same manner as such criteria for any organizational acquisition or procurement. The Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) Section 7.103 contains information security requirements from FISMA.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Contracts for information systems, components, or services must meet the privacy requirements of the Federal Government. It is much easier, and cheaper, to build privacy into a system at the acquisition phase of the life cycle than it is to bolt it on after the system is already acquired.

The high-level design for the system is expressed in terms of multiple subsystems and the interfaces between subsystems providing security-relevant functionality. The low-level design for the system is expressed in terms of modules with emphasis on software and firmware (but not excluding hardware) and the interfaces between modules providing security-relevant functionality. Source code and hardware schematics are typically referred to as the implementation representation of the information system.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    The identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services early in the system development life cycle (e.g., during the initial requirements definition and design phases) allows organizations to influence the design of the information system, information system component, or information system service. This early involvement in the life cycle helps organizations to avoid or minimize the use of functions, ports, protocols, or services that pose unnecessarily high risks and understand the trade-offs involved in blocking specific ports, protocols, or services (or when requiring information system service providers to do so). Early identification of functions, ports, protocols, and services avoids costly retrofitting of security controls after the information system, system component, or information system service has been implemented. SA-9 describes requirements for external information system services with organizations identifying which functions, ports, protocols, and services are provided from external sources.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control helps organizational personnel understand the implementation and operation of security controls associated with information systems, system components, and information system services. Organizations consider establishing specific measures to determine the quality/completeness of the content provided. The inability to obtain needed documentation may occur, for example, due to the age of the information system/component or lack of support from developers and contractors. In those situations, organizations may need to recreate selected documentation if such documentation is essential to the effective implementation or operation of security controls. The level of protection provided for selected information system, component, or service documentation is commensurate with the security category or classification of the system. For example, documentation associated with a key DoD weapons system or command and control system would typically require a higher level of protection than a routine administrative system. Documentation that addresses information system vulnerabilities may also require an increased level of protection. Secure operation of the information system, includes, for example, initially starting the system and resuming secure system operation after any lapse in system operation.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations apply security engineering principles primarily to new development information systems or systems undergoing major upgrades. For legacy systems, organizations apply security engineering principles to system upgrades and modifications to the extent feasible, given the current state of hardware, software, and firmware within those systems. Security engineering principles include, for example:

    (i) Developing layered protections;
    (ii) Establishing sound security policy, architecture, and controls as the foundation for design;
    (iii) Incorporating security requirements into the system development life cycle;
    (iv) Delineating physical and logical security boundaries;
    (v) Ensuring that system developers are trained on how to build secure software;
    (vi) Tailoring security controls to meet organizational and operational needs;
    (vii) Performing threat modeling to identify use cases, threat agents, attack vectors, and attack patterns as well as compensating controls and design patterns needed to mitigate risk; and
    (viii) Reducing risk to acceptable levels, thus enabling informed risk management decisions.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    When applying information system security engineering principles in the specification, design, development, implementation, and modification of an information system containing personally identifiable information (PII), the organization should apply privacy-enhanced system design and development principles described in NIST SP 800-53, Rev. 4, Appendix J.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    External information system services are services that are implemented outside of the authorization boundaries of organizational information systems. This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the Federal Government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. For services that are external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The information security requirements and controls are documented through a written contract, or other arrangement that meets the requirements of 45 C.F.R. §164.314(a).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The location of information processing, information/data storage, or information system services that are critical to organizations can have a direct impact on the ability of those organizations to successfully execute their missions/business functions. This situation exists when external providers control the location of processing, storage or services. The criteria external providers use for the selection of processing, storage, or service locations may be different from organizational criteria. For example, organizations may want to ensure that data/information storage locations are restricted to certain locations to facilitate incident response activities (e.g., forensic analyses, after-the-fact investigations) in case of information security breaches/compromises. Such incident response activities may be adversely affected by the governing laws or protocols in the locations where processing and storage occur and/or the locations from which information system services emanate.Other countries have different requirements for the protection of PII of either their own citizens or for transfer of PII across national borders. When selecting a service provider, the location for storage, maintenance, or processing must be considered. Some organizations, such as European Union member states, have very stringent data transfer restriction requirements and your organization may have a treaty or other agreement for data exchange and/or protection. Consult with your legal counsel or your organization's liaison to the Department of State.

    This control also applies to organizations conducting internal information systems development and integration. Organizations consider the quality and completeness of the configuration management activities conducted by developers as evidence of applying effective security safeguards. Safeguards include, for example, protecting from unauthorized modification or destruction, the master copies of all material used to generate security-relevant portions of the system hardware, software, and firmware. Maintaining the integrity of changes to the information system, information system component, or information system service requires configuration control throughout the system development life cycle to track authorized changes and prevent unauthorized changes. Configuration items that are placed under configuration management (if existence/use is required by other security controls) include: the formal model; the functional, high-level, and low-level design specifications; other design data; implementation documentation; source code and hardware schematics; the running version of the object code; tools for comparing new versions of security-relevant hardware descriptions and software/firmware source code with previous versions; and test fixtures and documentation. Depending on the mission/business needs of organizations and the nature of the contractual relationships in place, developers may provide configuration management support during the operations and maintenance phases of the life cycle.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Developmental security testing/evaluation occurs at all post-design phases of the system development life cycle. Such testing/evaluation confirms that the required security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, enforcing the desired security policy, and meeting established security requirements. Security properties of information systems may be affected by the interconnection of system components or changes to those components. These interconnections or changes (e.g., upgrading or replacing applications and operating systems) may adversely affect previously implemented security controls. This control provides additional types of security testing/evaluation that developers can conduct to reduce or eliminate potential flaws. Testing custom software applications may require approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Developers can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Security assessment plans provide the specific activities that developers plan to carry out including the types of analyses, testing, evaluation, and reviews of software and firmware components, the degree of rigor to be applied, and the types of artifacts produced during those processes. The depth of security testing/evaluation refers to the rigor and level of detail associated with the assessment process (e.g., black box, gray box, or white box testing). The coverage of security testing/evaluation refers to the scope (i.e., number and type) of the artifacts included in the assessment process. Contracts specify the acceptance criteria for security assessment plans, flaw remediation processes, and the evidence that the plans/processes have been diligently applied. Methods for reviewing and protecting assessment plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Testing is a key method to ensure privacy controls are implemented. Including privacy controls in the security assessment plan ensures they are tested.

    Penetration testing is an assessment methodology in which assessors, using all available information technology product and/or information system documentation (e.g., product/system design specifications, source code, and administrator/operator manuals) and working under specific constraints, attempt to circumvent implemented security features of information technology products and information systems. Penetration testing can include, for example, white, gray, or black box testing with analyses performed by skilled security professionals simulating adversary actions. The objective of penetration testing is to uncover potential vulnerabilities in information technology products and information systems resulting from implementation errors, configuration faults, or other operational deployment weaknesses or deficiencies. Penetration tests can be performed in conjunction with automated and manual code reviews to provide greater levels of analysis than would ordinarily be possible.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Dynamic code analysis provides run-time verification of software programs, using tools capable of monitoring programs for memory corruption, user privilege issues, and other potential security problems. Dynamic code analysis employs run-time tools to help to ensure that security functionality performs in the way it was designed. A specialized type of dynamic analysis, known as fuzz testing, induces program failures by deliberately introducing malformed or random data into software programs. Fuzz testing strategies derive from the intended use of applications and the functional and design specifications for the applications. To understand the scope of dynamic code analysis and hence the assurance provided, organizations may also consider conducting code coverage analysis (checking the degree to which the code has been tested using metrics such as percent of subroutines tested or percent of program statements called during execution of the test suite) and/or concordance analysis (checking for words that are out of place in software code such as non-English language words or derogatory terms).

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information systems (including system components that compose those systems) need to be protected throughout the system development life cycle (i.e., during design, development, manufacturing, packaging, assembly, distribution, system integration, operations, maintenance, and retirement). Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: (i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and (ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control enhancement also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: (i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; (ii) vetting development personnel; and (iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system. Contracts may specify documentation protection requirements.

        process.
  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control helps organizations to make explicit trustworthiness decisions when designing, developing, and implementing information systems that are needed to conduct critical organizational missions/business functions. Trustworthiness is a characteristic/property of an information system that expresses the degree to which the system can be expected to preserve the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the information it processes, stores, or transmits. Trustworthy information systems are systems that are capable of being trusted to operate within defined levels of risk despite the environmental disruptions, human errors, and purposeful attacks that are expected to occur in the specified environments of operation. Trustworthy systems are important to mission/business success. Two factors affecting the trustworthiness of information systems include: (i) security functionality (i.e., the security features, functions, and/or mechanisms employed within the system and its environment of operation); and (ii) security assurance (i.e., the grounds for confidence that the security functionality is effective in its application). Developers, implementers, operators, and maintainers of organizational information systems can increase the level of assurance (and trustworthiness), for example, by employing well-defined security policy models, structured and rigorous hardware, software, and firmware development techniques, sound system/security engineering principles, and secure configuration settings (defined by a set of assurance-related security controls in NIST 800-53 Appendix E).Assurance is also based on the assessment of evidence produced during the system development life cycle. Critical missions/business functions are supported by high-impact systems and the associated assurance requirements for such systems. The additional assurance controls in Table E-4 in NIST 800-53 Appendix E (designated as optional) can be used to develop and implement high-assurance solutions for specific information systems and system components using the concept of overlays described in NIST 800-53 Appendix I. Organizations select assurance overlays that have been developed, validated, and approved for community adoption (e.g., cross-organization, government wide), limiting the development of such overlays on an organization-by-organization basis. Organizations can conduct criticality analyses as described in SA-14, to determine the information systems, system components, or information system services that require high-assurance solutions. Trustworthiness requirements and assurance overlays can be described in the security plans for organizational information systems.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Preproduction environments may not be as formally controlled as production environments. Use of sensitive information, including PII, in a preproduction environment increases risk to the organization, because the preproduction environment may not be as secure as the production environment. If PII will be provided to a third-party during testing, the organization will need a formal MOA, MOU, or data exchange agreement before providing access to that third-party. Such agreement will at a minimum include how loss, theft, or compromise of PII is to be handled.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Because the information system, system component, or information system service may be employed in critical activities essential to the national and/or economic security interests of the United States, organizations have a strong interest in ensuring that the developer is trustworthy. The degree of trust required of the developer may need to be consistent with that of the individuals accessing the information system/component/service once deployed. Examples of authorization and personnel screening criteria include clearance, satisfactory background checks, citizenship, and nationality. Trustworthiness of developers may also include a review and analysis of company ownership and any relationships the company has with entities potentially affecting the quality/reliability of the systems, components, or services being developed.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Access to sensitive information, such as PII and protected health information (PHI), requires both a valid need to know as documented by an access authorization request and requires a background investigation (or appropriate screening) to ensure the individual being provided access is suitable. These access authorization requirements extend to developers of information systems containing sensitive information.

    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SC family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system management functionality includes, for example, functions necessary to administer databases, network components, workstations, and servers and typically requires privileged user access. The separation of user functionality from information system management functionality is either physical or logical. Organizations implement separation of system management-related functionality from user functionality by using different computers, different central processing units, different instances of operating systems, different network addresses, virtualization techniques, or combinations of these or other methods, as appropriate. This type of separation includes, for example, web administrative interfaces that use separate authentication methods for users of any other information system resources. Separation of system and user functionality may include isolating administrative interfaces on different domains and with additional access controls.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    It is necessary to store sensitive information, such as PII, on separate logical partitions from applications and software that provide user functionality to restrict accidental or unintentional loss of, or access to, sensitive information by both unauthorized users and unauthorized applications.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    The information system isolates security functions from non-security functions by means of an isolation boundary (implemented via partitions and domains). Such isolation controls access to and protects the integrity of the hardware, software, and firmware that perform those security functions. Information systems implement code separation (i.e., separation of security functions from non-security functions) in several ways, including, for example, through the provision of security kernels via processor rings or processor modes. For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Information systems restrict access to security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities. While the ideal is for all the code within the security function isolation boundary to only contain security-relevant code, it is sometimes necessary to include non-security functions within the isolation boundary as an exception.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Where it is not feasible to achieve strict isolation of non-security functions from security functions, it is necessary to take actions to minimize the non-security-relevant functions within the security function boundary. Non-security functions contained within the isolation boundary are considered security-relevant because errors or maliciousness in such software, by being within the boundary, can impact the security functions of organizational information systems. The design objective is that the specific portions of information systems providing information security are of minimal size/complexity. Minimizing the number of non-security functions in the security-relevant components of information systems allows designers and implementers to focus only on those functions which are necessary to provide the desired security capability (typically access enforcement). By minimizing non-security functions within the isolation boundaries, the amount of code that must be trusted to enforce security policies is reduced, thus contributing to understandability.

    The reduction in inter-module interactions helps to constrain security functions and to manage complexity. The concepts of coupling and cohesion are important with respect to modularity in software design. Coupling refers to the dependencies that one module has on other modules. Cohesion refers to the relationship between the different functions within a module. Good software engineering practices rely on modular decomposition, layering, and minimization to reduce and manage complexity, thus producing software modules that are highly cohesive and loosely coupled.

The control of information in shared resources is also commonly referred to as object reuse and residual information protection. This control does not address: (i) information remanence which refers to residual representation of data that has been nominally erased or removed; (ii) covert channels (including storage and/or timing channels) where shared resources are manipulated to violate information flow restrictions; or (iii) components within information systems for which there are only single users/roles.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Following use of a shared system resource, ensure that shared system resource(s) is purged of personally identifiable information (PII) to prevent unintended users or processes from accessing PII.

    Managed interfaces include, for example, gateways, routers, firewalls, guards, network-based malicious code analysis and virtualization systems, or encrypted tunnels implemented within a security architecture (e.g., routers protecting firewalls or application gateways residing on protected subnetworks). Subnetworks that are physically or logically separated from internal networks are referred to as demilitarized zones (DMZ). Restricting or prohibiting interfaces within organizational information systems includes, for example, restricting external web traffic to designated web servers within managed interfaces and prohibiting external traffic that appears to be spoofing internal addresses. Organizations consider the shared nature of commercial telecommunications services in the implementation of security controls associated with the use of such services. Commercial telecommunications services are commonly based on network components and consolidated management systems shared by all attached commercial customers and may also include third party-provided access lines and other service elements. Such transmission services may represent sources of increased risk despite contract security provisions. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control enhancement is implemented within remote devices (e.g., notebook computers) through configuration settings to disable split tunneling in those devices and by preventing those configuration settings from being readily configurable by users. This control enhancement is implemented within the information system by the detection of split tunneling (or of configuration settings that allow split tunneling) in the remote device and by prohibiting the connection if the remote device is using split tunneling. Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local information system resources such as printers/file servers. However, split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. The use of VPN for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance that it can effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections from the confidentiality and integrity perspective. VPNs thus provide a means for allowing non-remote communications paths from remote devices. The use of an adequately provisioned VPN does not eliminate the need to prevent split tunneling.

    External networks are networks outside of organizational control. A proxy server is a server (i.e., information system or application) that acts as an intermediary for clients requesting information system resources (e.g., files, connections, web pages, or services) from other organizational servers. Client requests established through an initial connection to the proxy server are evaluated to manage complexity and to provide additional protection by limiting direct connectivity. Web content filtering devices are one of the most common proxy servers providing access to the Internet. Proxy servers support logging individual TCP sessions and blocking specific URLs, domain names, and IP addresses. Web proxies can be configured with organization-defined lists of authorized and unauthorized websites.

    Organizations can isolate information system components performing different missions and/or business functions. Such isolation limits unauthorized information flows among system components and provides the opportunity to deploy greater levels of protection for selected components. Separating system components with boundary protection mechanisms provides the capability for increased protection of individual components and to more effectively control information flows between those components. This type of enhanced protection limits the potential harm from cyber-attacks and errors. The degree of separation provided varies depending upon the mechanisms chosen. Boundary protection mechanisms include, for example, routers, gateways, and firewalls; separating system components into physically separate networks or subnetworks; cross-domain devices separating subnetworks; virtualization techniques; and encrypting information flows among system components using distinct encryption keys.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control applies to both internal and external networks and all types of information system components from which information can be transmitted (e.g., servers, mobile devices, notebook computers, printers, copiers, scanners, facsimile machines). Communication paths outside the physical protection of a controlled boundary are exposed to the possibility of interception and modification. Protecting the confidentiality and/or integrity of organizational information can be accomplished by physical means (e.g., by employing physical distribution systems) or by logical means (e.g., employing encryption techniques). Organizations relying on commercial providers offering transmission services as commodity services rather than as fully dedicated services (i.e., services which can be highly specialized to individual customer needs) may find it difficult to obtain the necessary assurances regarding the implementation of needed security controls for transmission confidentiality/integrity. In such situations, organizations determine what types of confidentiality/integrity services are available in standard, commercial telecommunication service packages. If it is infeasible or impractical to obtain the necessary security controls and assurances of control effectiveness through appropriate contracting vehicles, organizations implement appropriate compensating security controls or explicitly accept the additional risk.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Cryptography can be employed to support a variety of security solutions including, for example, the protection of classified and Controlled Unclassified Information, the provision of digital signatures, and the enforcement of information separation when authorized individuals have the necessary clearances for such information but lack the necessary formal access approvals. Cryptography can also be used to support random number generation and hash generation. Generally applicable cryptographic standards include FIPS-validated cryptography and NSA-approved cryptography. This control does not impose any requirements on organizations to use cryptography. However, if cryptography is required based on the selection of other security controls, organizations define each type of cryptographic use and the type of cryptography required (e.g., protection of classified information: NSA-approved cryptography; provision of digital signatures: FIPS-validated cryptography).This control applies to applications with an integrated access control mechanism, such as WinZip and SecureZip, as well as the underlying operating system. These applications must meet CMS (FIPS 140-2 validated module) requirements.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    FIPS-validated cryptographic modules are the government standard for encryption. When sensitive information such as PII requires encryption, the organization must comply with these standards.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization. However, using cryptographic protection allows the organization to utilize the "Safe Harbor"provision under the Breach Notification Rule.  If PHI is encrypted pursuant to the Guidance Specifying the Technologies and Methodologies that Render Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals (45 C.F.R. Part 164 Subpart D), then no breach notification is required following an impermissible use or disclosure of the information. Therefore, organizations should use cryptographic protections for PHI stored on electronic media.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the confidentiality and integrity of information at rest and covers user information and system information. Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems. System-related information requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including, for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Because of the sensitivity of PII and protected health information (PHI), the confidentiality and integrity of such information must be assured for data at rest.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization. However, using cryptographic protection allows the organization to utilize the "Safe Harbor"provision under the Breach Notification Rule.  If PHI is encrypted pursuant to the Guidance Specifying the Technologies and Methodologies that Render Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals (74 FR 42740), then no breach notification is required following an impermissible use or disclosure of the information.  Therefore, organizations should use cryptographic protections for PHI stored on electronic media.

        information at rest.
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Selection of cryptographic mechanisms is based on the need to protect the confidentiality and integrity of organizational information. The strength of mechanism is commensurate with the security category and/or classification of the information. This control enhancement applies to significant concentrations of digital media in organizational areas designated for media storage and to limited quantities of media generally associated with information system components in operational environments (e.g., portable storage devices, mobile devices). Organizations have the flexibility to either encrypt all information on storage devices (i.e., full disk encryption) or encrypt specific data structures (e.g., files, records, or fields). Organizations employing cryptographic mechanisms to protect information at rest also consider cryptographic key management solutions. For additional Guidance, see: HHS Standard for Encryption of Computing Devices and Information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Because of the sensitivity of PII and PHI, the confidentiality and integrity of such information must be assured for data at rest using encryption technologies if assurance is not provided by other means.Organizations may use file share scanning (e.g., data loss prevention [DLP] technology) to ensure compliance with the requirement to encrypt PII/protected health information (PHI) at rest.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization. However, using cryptographic protection allows the organization to utilize the "Safe Harbor"provision under the Breach Notification Rule.  If PHI is encrypted pursuant to the Guidance Specifying the Technologies and Methodologies that Render Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system partitioning is a part of a defense-in-depth protection strategy. Organizations determine the degree of physical separation of system components from physically distinct components in separate racks in the same room, to components in separate rooms for the more critical components, to more significant geographical separation of the most critical components. Security categorization can guide the selection of appropriate candidates for domain partitioning. Managed interfaces restrict or prohibit network access and information flow among partitioned information system components.

    Information systems can maintain separate execution domains for each executing process by assigning each process a separate address space. Each information system process has a distinct address space so that communication between processes is performed in a manner controlled through the security functions, and one process cannot modify the executing code of another process. Maintaining separate execution domains for executing processes can be achieved, for example, by implementing separate address spaces. This capability is available in most commercial operating systems that employ multi-state processor technologies.

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations identify information systems affected by announced software flaws, including potential vulnerabilities resulting from those flaws, and report this information to designated organizational personnel with information security responsibilities. Security-relevant software updates include, for example, patches, service packs, and hot fixes. Organizations also address flaws discovered during security assessments, continuous monitoring, incident response activities, and system error handling. Organizations take advantage of available resources such as the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) or Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases in remediating flaws discovered in organizational information systems. By incorporating flaw remediation into ongoing configuration management processes, required/anticipated remediation actions can be tracked and verified. Flaw remediation actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether organizations follow United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors, including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates are not necessary or practical. Organizations may also consider in testing decisions, whether security-relevant software or firmware updates are obtained from authorized sources with appropriate digital signatures.Operating systems and installed applications, including databases and services, need to be examined.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system entry and exit points include, for example, firewalls, electronic mail servers, web servers, proxy servers, remote-access servers, workstations, notebook computers, and mobile devices. Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported by different means, including, for example, web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards, including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Malicious code protections are essential in system with PHI because of the sensitivity and desirability of such information.Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization.

        that the system is functioning in an optimal, resilient, and secure state;
        identifies irregularities or anomalies that are indicators of a system malfunction
        or compromise; and detects information system attacks.
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real-time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from DHS can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, HTTP traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Intrusion-monitoring tools may collect personally identifiable information (PII) of all types. Notice to users who are monitored should be provided prior to system use. Controls sufficient to protect the type of PII collected must be in place for the technology performing the monitoring, including encryption of monitoring data that may contain PII. When conducting information system monitoring on internal or external networks which may collect PII, the organization should coordinate with the organization's counsel and privacy officer.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Indicators of compromise (IOC) are forensic artifacts from intrusions that are identified on organizational information systems (at the host or network level). IOCs provide organizations with valuable information on objects or information systems that have been compromised. IOCs for the discovery of compromised hosts can include for example, the creation of registry key values. IOCs for network traffic include, for example, Universal Resource Locator (URL) or protocol elements that indicate malware command and control servers. The rapid distribution and adoption of IOCs can improve information security by reducing the time that information systems and organizations are vulnerable to the same exploit or attack.See also: <http://www.issa.org/resource/resmgr/journalpdfs/feature0515.pdf>

    The US-CERT generates security alerts and advisories to maintain situational awareness across the Federal Government. Security directives are issued by OMB or other designated organizations with the responsibility and authority to issue such directives. Compliance to security directives is essential due to the critical nature of many of these directives and the potential immediate adverse effects on organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation should the directives not be implemented in a timely manner. External organizations include, for example, external mission/business partners, supply chain partners, external service providers, and other peer/supporting organizations.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Receiving and acting on security alerts from US-CERT, or other appropriate organizations, assists in protecting PHI by protecting information systems against rapidly evolving threats.Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization.

    Cryptographic mechanisms used for the protection of integrity include, for example, digital signatures and the computation and application of signed hashes using asymmetric cryptography, protecting the confidentiality of the key used to generate the hash, and using the public key to verify the hash information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Detection of unauthorized changes to sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) and systems containing sensitive information is fundamental to ensuring data integrity. FIPS-validated cryptographic modules are the government standard for integrity verification. When PII requires integrity verification the organization must comply with these standards.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. § 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization. However, using cryptographic protection allows the organization to utilize the "Safe Harbor"provision under the Breach Notification Rule.  If PHI is encrypted pursuant to the Guidance Specifying the Technologies and Methodologies that Render Protected Health Information Unusable, Unreadable, or Indecipherable to Unauthorized Individuals (45 C.F.R. Part 164 Subpart D), then no breach notification is required following an impermissible use or disclosure of the information. Therefore, organizations should use cryptographic protections for PHI stored on electronic media

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Checking the valid syntax and semantics of information system inputs (e.g., character set, length, numerical range, and acceptable values) verifies that inputs match specified definitions for format and content. Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Information input validation serves two important purposes for protecting PII:  (1) When PII is entered, validation techniques support data quality measures (e.g., ensuring the PII entered is the expected type and format of data); and  (2) It provides the capability to limit or exclude PII from being entered within a field (e.g., recognizing a restricted format, such as an SSN) that should not contain the PII.

        be exploited by adversaries.
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations carefully consider the structure/content of error messages. The extent to which information systems can identify and handle error conditions is guided by organizational policy and operational requirements. Information that could be exploited by adversaries includes, for example, erroneous logon attempts with passwords entered by mistake as the username, mission/business information that can be derived from (if not stated explicitly by) information recorded, and personal information such as account numbers, Social Security Numbers, and credit card numbers. In addition, error messages may provide a covert channel for transmitting information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    An error in a system may reveal sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PIIP or protected health information (PHI). For example, if there is an error posting a form that contains PII and the system includes the PII entered in the form when it writes to the error log, it will be visible to whoever has access permissions to the error log. Therefore, error handling must be considered in design of the system, and access to errors containing leaked sensitive information should be provided only to those individuals with a need for that information in the performance of their duties.

    Some adversaries launch attacks with the intent of executing code in non-executable regions of memory or in memory locations that are prohibited. Security safeguards employed to protect memory include, for example, data execution prevention and address space layout randomization. Data execution prevention safeguards can either be hardware-enforced or software-enforced with hardware providing the greater strength of mechanism.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Information security program plans can be represented in single documents or compilations of documents at the discretion of organizations. The plans document the program management controls and organization-defined common controls. Information security program plans provide sufficient information about the program management controls/common controls (including specification of parameters for any assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable implementations that are unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and a determination of the risk to be incurred if the plans are implemented as intended.The security plans for individual information systems and the organization-wide information security program plan together, provide complete coverage for all security controls employed within the organization. Common controls are documented in an appendix to the organization's information security program plan unless the controls are included in a separate security plan for an information system (e.g., security controls employed as part of an intrusion detection system providing organization-wide boundary protection inherited by one or more organizational information systems). The organization-wide information security program plan will indicate which separate security plans contain descriptions of common controls.Organizations have the flexibility to describe common controls in a single document or in multiple documents. In the case of multiple documents, the documents describing common controls are included as attachments to the information security program plan. If the information security program plan contains multiple documents, the organization specifies in each document the organizational official or officials responsible for the development, implementation, assessment, authorization, and monitoring of the respective common controls. For example, the organization may require that the Facilities Management Office develop, implement, assess, authorize, and continuously monitor common physical and environmental protection controls from the PE family when such controls are not associated with an information system but instead, support multiple information systems.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The organization's approach to protection of personally identifiable information (PII) should be included in the information security program plan, including defining roles and responsibilities for protecting PII.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    The enterprise architecture developed by the organization is aligned with the Federal Enterprise Architecture (FEA). The integration of information security requirements and associated security controls into the organization's enterprise architecture helps to ensure that security considerations are addressed by organizations early in the system development life cycle and are directly and explicitly related to the organization's mission/business processes. This process of security requirements integration also embeds into the enterprise architecture, an integral information security architecture consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies. For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed at a system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all the organizational information systems. For PL-8, the information security architecture is developed at a level representing an individual information system, but at the same time is consistent with the information security architecture defined for the organization. Security requirements and security control integration are most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk Management Framework and supporting security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology provides guidance on integrating information security requirements and security controls into enterprise architectures.

    Information protection needs are technology-independent, required capabilities to counter threats to organizations, individuals, or the Nation through the compromise of information (i.e., loss of confidentiality, integrity, or availability). Information protection needs are derived from the mission/business needs defined by the organization, the mission/business processes selected to meet the stated needs, and the organizational risk management strategy. Information protection needs determine the required security controls for the organization and the associated information systems supporting the mission/business processes. Inherent in defining an organization's information protection needs is an understanding of the level of adverse impact that could result if a compromise of information occurs. The security categorization process is used to make such potential impact determinations. Mission/business process definitions and associated information protection requirements are documented by the organization in accordance with organizational policy and procedure.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Organizations handling classified information are required, under Executive Order 13587 and the National Policy on Insider Threat, to establish insider threat programs. The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include security controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior organizational official is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training to employees, receive access to information from all offices within the department/agency (e.g., human resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology, information system security, and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department/agency insider threat posture.Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g., ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues). These precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is important to ensure that all monitoring activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The privacy risks inherent with aggregating sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from multiple data resources within an organization, such as human resource and background investigation information, and the potential for scope creep require the active participation, review, and concurrence of the Privacy Officer.

    Because of the constantly changing and increasing sophistication of adversaries, especially the advanced persistent threat (APT), it is becoming more likely that adversaries may successfully breach or compromise organizational information systems. One of the best techniques to address this concern is for organizations to share threat information. This can include, for example, sharing threat events (i.e., tactics, techniques, and procedures) that organizations have experienced, mitigations that organizations have found are effective against certain types of threats, and threat intelligence (i.e., indications and warnings about threats that are likely to occur). Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g., organizations taking part in threat-sharing consortia). Threat information may be highly sensitive requiring special agreements and protection, or less sensitive and freely shared.

    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the AP family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security and privacy policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Effective implementation of privacy and security controls requires a collaborative partnering of the SAOP (or Chief Privacy Officer [CPO]), CIO, and CISO. To maximize organizational compliance with privacy requirements and best practices, the organization should ensure its privacy professionals engage with both its security community and the Federal privacy community to remain current and to share lessons-learned or other privacy-related information.The development and implementation of a comprehensive governance and privacy program demonstrates organizational accountability for and commitment to the protection of individual privacy. Accountability begins with the appointment of a SOP with the authority, mission, resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy program. The SOP, in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and others as appropriate: (i) ensures the development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy policies and procedures; (ii) defines roles and responsibilities for protecting PII; (iii) determines the level of information sensitivity with regard to PII holdings; (iv) identifies the laws, regulations, and internal policies that apply to the PII; (v) monitors privacy best practices; and (vi) monitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls.To further accountability, the SOP develops privacy plans to document the privacy requirements of organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and supports resource requests by the SOP. A single plan or multiple plans may be necessary depending upon the organizational structures, requirements, and resources, and the plan(s) may vary in comprehensiveness. For example, a one-page privacy plan may cover privacy policies, documentation, and controls already in place, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and System of Records Notices (SORN). A comprehensive plan may include a baseline of privacy controls selected from this appendix and include: (i) processes for conducting privacy risk assessments; (ii) templates and guidance for completing PIAs and SORNs; (iii) privacy training and awareness requirements; (iv) requirements for contractors processing PII; (v) plans for eliminating unnecessary PII holdings; and (vi) a framework for measuring annual performance goals and objectives for implementing identified privacy controls.Ongoing contact with privacy groups and associations is of paramount importance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Privacy groups and associations include, for example, special interest groups, forums, professional associations, news groups, and/or peer groups of privacy professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select groups and associations based on organizational missions/business functions. Organizations share threat, vulnerability, and incident information consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Effective implementation of privacy risk management processes requires both organizational and information system processes across the life cycle of the organization's mission, business processes, and information systems. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) are structured reviews (qualitative and quantitative) of both the risk and effect of how information is handled and maintained as well as the potential impacts or harms to individuals and organizations for loss of control or mishandling of the PII. The term "PIA"may refer to the process of conducting such an assessment, or the document produced as a result of that assessment. A PIA-like process benefits an organization and the individuals whose PII is in the information system by enabling the organization to identify, evaluate, and manage the privacy risks for the PII in that system.Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The tools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. Such tools include, but are not limited to, conducting PIAs. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on the timing for developing PIAs for information systems and electronic collections of information. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and are updated when changes create new privacy risks.Information system privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycle of an information system collecting, using, maintaining, and/or disseminating PII. Such privacy risk management processes include, but are not limited to, design requirements, privacy threshold analysis, privacy impact assessments (PIA), and implementation of secure disposition. While Section 208 of the E-Government Act does not require — or prohibit — a PIA for a national security system (NSS), as defined at 40 U.S.C. §11103 (see Section 202(i) of the E-Government Act), an organization may benefit from conducting a PIA or similar privacy risk evaluation on NSS as part of their internal risk management process to ensure privacy risks are identified, evaluated, and managed in information systems containing PII. For this reason, the ARS extends the requirement to develop a PIA to all information systems.

  Implementation Standards:
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Monitoring and auditing activities ensure privacy controls are implemented and operating effectively.To promote accountability, organizations identify and address gaps in privacy compliance, management, operational, and technical controls by conducting regular assessments (e.g., internal risk assessments). These assessments can be self-assessments or third-party audits that result in reports on compliance gaps identified in programs, projects, and information systems. In addition to auditing for effective implementation of all privacy controls identified in [800-53 Appendix J], organizations assess whether they: (i) implement a process to embed privacy considerations into the life cycle of personally identifiable information (PII), programs, information systems, mission/business processes, and technology; (ii) monitor for changes to applicable privacy laws, regulations, and policies; (iii) track programs, information systems, and applications that collect and maintain PII to ensure compliance; (iv) ensure that access to PII is only on a need-to-know basis; and (v) ensure that PII is being maintained and used only for the legally authorized purposes identified in the public notice(s).Organizations also: (i) implement technology to audit for the security, appropriate use, and loss of PII; (ii) perform reviews to ensure physical security of documents containing PII; (iii) assess contractor compliance with privacy requirements; and (iv) ensure that corrective actions identified as part of the assessment process are tracked and monitored until audit findings are corrected. The Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) coordinates monitoring and auditing efforts with information security officials and ensures that the results are provided to senior managers and oversight officials.Where security and privacy controls align, to achieve the most efficient and effective implementation, the CMS SOP/CPO and CIO or CISO should coordinate to develop a single organizational process to conduct audit and monitoring.

    Privacy Training is an effective means to reduce privacy risk for an organization and is mandated by the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, and OMB M-17-12.Through implementation of a privacy training and awareness strategy, the organization promotes a culture of privacy. Privacy training and awareness programs typically focus on broad topics, such as responsibilities under the Privacy Act of 1974 and E-Government Act of 2002 and the consequences of failing to carry out those responsibilities, how to identify new privacy risks, how to mitigate privacy risks, and how and when to report privacy incidents. Privacy training may also target data collection and use requirements identified in public notices, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) or System of Records Notices (SORN) for a program or information system. Specific training methods may include: (i) mandatory annual privacy awareness training; (ii) targeted, role-based training; (iii) internal privacy program websites; (iv) manuals, guides, and handbooks; (v) slide presentations; (vi) events (e.g., privacy awareness week, privacy clean-up day); (vii) posters and brochures; and (viii) email messages to all employees and contractors. Organizations update training based on changing statutory, regulatory, mission, program, business process, and information system requirements, or on the results of compliance monitoring and auditing. Where appropriate, organizations may provide privacy training as part of existing information security training.Privacy training may be integrated with general IA training. Examples of jobs or roles that would require job-specific privacy and security training include: human resource personnel who have greater access to PII; system developers who design, develop and implement information systems containing PII; and system administrators who operate and maintain information systems containing PII.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Automating privacy controls provides a concrete way of ensuring information systems are behaving in a way that is intended to achieve privacy objectives. Implementation of this control enables organizations to automate application of privacy controls. One simple example, which many organizations have already implemented, is TR-1, "Privacy Notice."This concept is one part of the most commonly recognized approaches to "building privacy in,"which is sometimes also known as "Privacy by Design."Privacy by Design is an internationally accepted privacy best practice endorsed by the Federal Trade Commission in their March 2012 Final Report, "Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: Recommendations for Businesses and Policymakers,"and embodies the same principles of the Privacy Act and Section 208 of the E-Government Act requiring privacy protections and safeguards before establishing or operating a system that may contain PII. Privacy by Design calls for considering privacy risks in the design and management of information systems. In addition to building in security and privacy controls discussed throughout the ARS, this control considers additional privacy-specific system characteristics and controls that must be built into the system to address privacy risks.To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems, organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building privacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII, thereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization's privacy policy. Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in a manner compatible with those purposes.Additional guidance on privacy-enhanced design and development may be found in the HHS Enterprise Performance Lifecycle (EPLC). Regardless of the systems engineering lifecycle used, privacy requirements should be considered during system design and development and validated and verified along with other system requirements. Validation ensures the correct requirements were identified. Verification ensures the requirements were implemented correctly.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Both the Privacy Act and HIPAA require accountings of disclosures in certain circumstances. There are differences in the requirements to account for disclosures under the Privacy Act and under HIPAA.The Senior Official for Privacy (SOP), periodically consults with managers of their organization's systems of records to ensure that the required accountings of disclosures of records are being properly maintained and provided to persons named in those records consistent with the dictates of the Privacy Act. Organizations are not required to keep an accounting of disclosures when the disclosures are made to individuals with a need to know, are made pursuant to the Freedom of Information Act, or are made to a law enforcement agency pursuant to 5 U.S.C. §552a(c)(3). Heads of agencies can promulgate rules to exempt certain systems of records from the requirement to provide the accounting of disclosures to individuals.

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security and privacy policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    When a record is used to make determinations related to a right, benefit, or privilege for an individual, the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, requires the information used be accurate, relevant, timely, and complete to assure fairness to the individual in the determination. Agencies should ensure the quality of all its PII, even if it is not protected by the Privacy Act. Organization's data quality assurance process should be commensurate with the impact to an individual's rights, benefits, or privileges as determined by the system owner in consultation with the organization's privacy office.Organizations take reasonable steps to confirm the accuracy and relevance of PII. Such steps may include, for example, editing and validating addresses as they are collected or entered into information systems using automated address verification look-up application programming interfaces (API). The types of measures taken to protect data quality are based on the nature and context of the PII, how it is to be used, and how it was obtained. Measures taken to validate the accuracy of PII that is used to make determinations about the rights, benefits, or privileges of individuals under federal programs may be more comprehensive than those used to validate less sensitive PII. Additional steps may be necessary to validate PII that is obtained from sources other than individuals or the authorized representatives of individuals.When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (e.g., a patient's health data), organizations incorporate mechanisms into information systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the information is to be updated.When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature (such as, but not limited to, when it is used for annual reconfirmation of a taxpayer's income for a recurring benefit or adjudication of an employee's clearance), organizations should incorporate mechanisms into information systems and develop corresponding procedures for how frequently, and by what method, the information is to be confirmed accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Frequency of confirmation should be commensurate with the impact to an individual's rights, benefits, or privileges as determined by the system owner in consultation with the organization's privacy office.

    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the DI family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security and privacy policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Coordinating review of the organization's holdings of PII with existing system review processes maximizes the efficient use of organization resources and will ensure all PII retained, even if the PII is not maintained in a Privacy Act system of records, is relevant and accurate. Reducing PII to the minimum required to accomplish the legally authorized purpose of collection and retaining PII for the minimum necessary period of time reduces the risk of PII breaches and will reduce the risk of the organization making decisions based on inaccurate PII.Organizations take appropriate steps to ensure that the collection of PII is consistent with a purpose authorized by law or regulation. The minimum set of PII elements required to support a specific organization's business process may be a subset of the PII the organization is authorized to collect. Program officials and program representatives such as Data Guardians consult with the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) and legal counsel to identify the minimum PII elements required by the information system or activity to accomplish the legally authorized purpose.Organizations can further reduce their privacy and security risks by also reducing their inventory of PII, where appropriate. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to conduct both an initial review and subsequent reviews of their holdings of all PII and ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that such holdings are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Organizations are also directed by OMB to reduce their holdings to the minimum necessary for the proper performance of a documented organizational business purpose. OMB Memorandum 17-12 requires organizations to develop and publicize, either through a notice in the Federal Register or on their websites, a schedule for periodic reviews of their holdings to supplement the initial review. Organizations coordinate with their federal records officers to ensure that reductions in organizational holdings of PII are consistent with NARA retention schedules.Organizations should coordinate the PII holdings reviews with the systems' annual information security reviews schedule to the maximum extent practicable.By performing periodic evaluations, organizations reduce risk, ensure that they are collecting only the data specified in the notice, and ensure that the data collected is still relevant and necessary for the purpose(s) specified in the notice.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Both the Privacy Act and the Federal Records Act require records to be maintained and disposed of in accordance with a published Records Schedule. Disposal and destruction of PII must be done securely so that it may not be reconstructed.NARA provides retention schedules that govern the disposition of federal records. Program officials and business owners coordinate with records officers, Cyber Risk Advisors, and with NARA to identify appropriate retention periods and disposal methods. NARA may require organizations to retain PII longer than is operationally needed. In those situations, organizations describe such requirements in the notice. Methods of storage include, for example, electronic, optical media (such as CDs or DVDs), or paper.Examples of ways organizations may reduce holdings include reducing the types of PII held (e.g., delete Social Security Numbers if their use is no longer needed) or shortening the retention period for PII that is maintained if it is no longer necessary to keep PII for long periods of time (this effort is undertaken in consultation with an organization's records officer to receive NARA approval). In both examples, organizations provide notice (e.g., an updated System of Records Notice) to inform the public of any changes in holdings of PII.Certain read-only archiving techniques, such as DVDs, CDs, microfilm, or microfiche may not permit the removal of individual records without the destruction of the entire database contained on such media.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    When developing and testing information systems, PII is at a heightened risk for accidental loss, theft, or compromise. Therefore, the organization needs to take measures to reduce that risk.Organizations often use PII for testing new applications or information systems prior to deployment. Organizations also use PII for research purposes and for training. The use of PII in testing, research, and training increases risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the information. If PII must be used, organizations take measures to minimize any associated risks and to authorize the use of and limit the amount of PII for these purposes. Organizations consult with the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) and legal counsel to ensure that the use of PII in testing, training, and research is compatible with the original purpose for which it was collected.When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature, to the greatest extent possible, PII should not be used when testing or developing an information system.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    HIPAA has specific requirements for the use of PHI in training or research.  As indicated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule's "health care operations"definition (45 C.F.R. §164.501), covered entities may use PHI for conducting training programs in which students, trainees, or practitioners in areas of health care learn under supervision to practice or improve their skills as health care providers. Covered entities may also use PHI for conducting training of non-health care professionals, and in the course of accreditation, certification, licensing, or credentialing activities. For additional information on when and how covered entities may use PHI to conduct research, see 45 C.F.R. §164.512(i).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Anonymizing PII is one technique to reduce risk and decreases the potential impact if the PII is compromised.Organizations can minimize risk to privacy of PII by using techniques such as de-identification.When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature, to the maximum extent possible, PII should be anonymized in accordance with NIST SP 800-122 prior to its use in development or testing.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under HIPAA, there are three acceptable approaches to minimizing the risk to privacy when using PHI for research, testing or training.  The first is the de-identification of information that results in that information no longer being classified as PHI.  There are only two methods for de-identification permitted by HIPAA.  For specific details on those two methods see 45 C.F.R. §164.514(a).  The second requirement is commonly referred to as the "Minimum Necessary Rule"which limits the amount of PHI used or disclosed to that which is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the request for information is made.  See 45 §C.F.R. §164.514(d).  The third requirement allows covered entities to use or disclose a "limited data set", which excludes certain direct identifiers.  Unlike de-identified data, a limited data set is PHI and any use or disclosure must meet specific requirements set out on the HIPAA Privacy Rule. See 45 C.F.R. §164.514(e).

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Individual participation and agreement to provide information is fundamental to an individual making an informed decision regarding the collection, use, and safeguarding of their PII.Consent is fundamental to the participation of individuals in the decision-making process regarding the collection and use of their PII and the use of technologies that may increase risk to personal privacy. To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals appropriate notice of the purposes of the PII collection or technology use and a means for individuals to consent to the activity. Organizations tailor the public notice and consent mechanisms to meet operational needs. Organizations achieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated public notices.Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied consent. Opt-in consent is the preferred method, but it is not always feasible. Opt-in requires that individuals take affirmative action to allow organizations to collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an individual to click a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In contrast, opt-out requires individuals to act to prevent the new or continued collection or use of such PII. For example, the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals to opt-out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list. Implied consent is the least preferred method and should be used only in limited circumstances. Implied consent occurs where individuals' behavior or failure to object indicates agreement with the collection or use of PII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has been posted that security cameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video recording). Depending upon the nature of the program or information system, it may be appropriate to allow individuals to limit the types of PII they provide and subsequent uses of that PII. Organizational consent mechanisms include a discussion of the consequences to individuals of failure to provide PII. Consequences can vary from organization to organization.Whenever feasible, opt-in is the preferred method to obtain consent.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    The Individual Participation Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPP) requires organizations to provide mechanisms for individuals to gain access to their PII when appropriate. The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, requires organizations to provide mechanisms for individuals to gain access to their PII when that PII meets the definition of a "record."Access is also an important aspect of supporting correction of PII and redress against alleged violations and misuse of their PII. In addition to access requirements under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, HIPAA has statutory requirements to provide access to PHI.Access affords individuals the ability to review PII about them held within organizational systems of records. Access includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to data. Organizational processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal requirements, or other factors. The Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) working with the Privacy Act Officer is responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request processing, in consultation with legal counsel. Access to certain types of records may not be appropriate, however, and heads of agencies may promulgate rules exempting systems from the access provision of the Privacy Act. For example, individuals are not entitled to access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. For other examples where agencies may promulgate rules exempting systems from the access provision, see the Privacy Act at 5 USC § 552a, subsections (j) (General Exemptions) and (k) (Specific Exemptions).Organizations must provide for public access to records, including PII not included in a Privacy Act System of Records, where required or appropriate. While the language of this control is specific to the Privacy Act's requirements for access, FIPPs encourage organizations to use available authorities to provide access when the Privacy Act does not apply. For example, some organizations use the Freedom of Information Act as another tool to provide access to PII for an affected individual.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Redress supports data integrity requirements for PII by providing a process for individuals to request correction of, or amendment to, their PII maintained by an organization.Redress supports the ability of individuals to ensure the accuracy of PII held by organizations. Effective redress processes demonstrate organizational commitment to data quality especially in those business functions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate decisions or denial of benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in determining if records are to be corrected or amended, based on the scope of redress requests, the changes sought, and the impact of the changes. Individuals may appeal an adverse decision and have incorrect, incomplete, or out-of-date information amended, where appropriate.To provide effective redress, organizations: (i) provide effective notice of the existence of a PII collection; (ii) provide plain language explanations of the processes and mechanisms for requesting access to records; (iii) establish criteria for submitting requests for correction or amendment; (iv) implement resources to analyze and adjudicate requests; (v) implement means of correcting or amending data collections; and (vi) review any decisions that may have been the result of inaccurate information.Organizational redress processes provide responses to individuals of decisions to deny requests for correction or amendment, including the reasons for those decisions, a means to record individual objections to the organizational decisions, and a means of requesting organizational reviews of the initial determinations. Where PII is corrected, or amended, organizations take steps to ensure that all authorized recipients of that PII are informed of the corrected or amended information. In instances where redress involves information obtained from other organizations, redress processes include coordination with organizations that originally collected the information.

Information received from complaints provides external input regarding organizational privacy and security practices which may improve processes and systems involved in collection, use, and maintenance of personally identifiable information (PII).Complaints, concerns, and questions from individuals can serve as a valuable source of external input that ultimately improves operational models, uses of technology, data collection practices, and privacy and security safeguards. Organizations provide complaint mechanisms that are readily accessible by the public, include all information necessary for successfully filing complaints (including contact information for the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) or other official designated to receive complaints), and are easy to use. Organizational complaint management processes include tracking mechanisms to ensure that all complaints received are reviewed and appropriately addressed in a timely manner.

Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security and privacy policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    The PII inventory identifies the organization's information assets and identifies those assets collecting, using, maintaining, or sharing PII. The PII inventory identifies those assets most likely to impact privacy; provides a starting point for organizations to implement effective administrative, technical, and physical security policies and procedures to protect PII; and to mitigate risks of PII exposure.The PII inventory enables organizations to identify systems and programs that contain PII so that they can then identify and address privacy risks. The PII inventory identifies:

    (i) the name and acronym for each program and system identified;
    (ii) the types of PII contained in that system;
    (iii) classification of level of sensitivity of all types of PII as collected, used, maintained, or shared by that information system; and
    (iv) classification of level of potential risk of substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals, as well as the financial or reputational risks to organizations, if PII is exposed.

    Organizations gather information on the location of PII as they are developing and updating systems and programs. In addition, they cross reference information in privacy impact assessments (PIA) and system of records notices (SORN) to ensure that PIAs and SORNs are consistent with the PII inventory. Organizations may extract the following information elements from Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) for information systems containing PII:

    (i) the name and acronym for each system identified;
    (ii) the types of PII contained in that system;
    (iii) classification of level of sensitivity of all types of PII, as combined in that information system; and
    (iv) classification of level of potential risk of substantial harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals, as well as the financial or reputational risks to organizations, if PII is exposed.

    Organizations take due care in creating and updating the inventories by identifying linkable data that could create PII.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Developing and implementing a risk-based analysis for privacy breaches using a "Best Judgment Standard"as described in this control's supplemental guidance ensures consistency in, and avoids over-reporting of, privacy breach notifications.The organizational Privacy Incident and Breach Response Plan may be integrated with the organizational Incident Response Plan.  The organization privacy incident and breach response capability must be able to demonstrate knowledge of the privacy incident and breach response processes and procedures and evidence showing the plan is followed routinely while responding to privacy incidents and breaches.In contrast to the Incident Response (IR) family in NIST 800-53 Appendix F, which concerns a broader range of incidents affecting information security, this control uses the term Privacy Incident to describe only those incidents that relate to personally identifiable information (PII). The organization Privacy Incident Response Plan is developed under the leadership of the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP). The plan includes: (i) The establishment of a cross-functional Privacy Incident Response Team that reviews, approves, and participates in the execution of the Privacy Incident Response Plan; (ii) A process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and to provide that notice accordingly; (iii) A privacy risk assessment process to determine the extent of harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals and, where appropriate, to take steps to mitigate any such risks; (iv) Internal procedures to ensure prompt reporting by employees and contractors of any privacy incident to the SOP and other designated officials consistent with organizational incident management structures; and (v) Internal procedures for reporting noncompliance with organizational privacy policy by employees or contractors to appropriate management or oversight officials. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to provide notice to oversight organizations in the event of a breach.Organizations may also choose to integrate Privacy Incident Response Plans with Security Incident Response Plans or keep the plans separate.The Best Judgment Standard, explained in OMB M-17-12, Footnote 6, imposes a requirement for organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. The Best Judgment Standard gives organizations responsibility for their own data in two important ways. First, the organization must determine the sensitivity of its PII, based on the information and the context in which the information appears. Second, the organization must determine whether a privacy breach should be reported, based on the resultant privacy risk to the organization and to affected individuals. The Best Judgment Standard effectively imposes a requirement on organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. In the context of breach reporting, the purpose of the Best Judgment Standard is to limit reporting to those privacy breaches which meet the organization's risk threshold. Conversely, under the Best Judgment Standard, organizations are not required to report privacy breaches that do not meet their risk threshold. The policy provides an example of implementing the Best Judgment Standard as discarding a document with the author's name on the front and no other PII into an office trashcan, positing that this probably would fall below and organization's risk threshold and would not need to be reported. OMB M-17-12 does not provide bright line rules to define what is considered "sensitive PII"using the common dictionary definition approach to the language in the memorandum–and under what circumstances a privacy breach should be reported, both because it would be a futile effort to attempt to delineate or predict the myriad potential contexts and situations, and agencies are in the best position to know and understand the relevant circumstances of their PII to determine which PII is sensitive and which breaches create risk.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    This control addresses the establishment of policy and procedures for the effective implementation of selected security controls and control enhancements in the SE family. Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security and privacy program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security and privacy policy for organizations or conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Providing the appropriate notification of privacy practices to the individual enables the individual to make an informed decision when they provide their consent.Effective notice, by virtue of its clarity, readability, and comprehensiveness, enables individuals to understand how an organization uses PII generally and, where appropriate, to make an informed decision prior to providing PII to an organization. Effective notice also demonstrates the privacy considerations that the organization has addressed in implementing its information practices. The organization may provide public notice through a variety of means. Some of these may be required by law or regulations, such as system of records notices (SORN) for Privacy Act systems, privacy impact assessments (PIA) for agency information systems and electronic collections of information, and website privacy policies for agency websites. As required by the Privacy Act, the organization also provides direct notice to individuals via Privacy Act Statements on the paper and electronic forms it uses to collect PII, or on separate forms that can be retained by the individuals.The Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) is responsible for the content of the organization's public notices, in consultation with legal counsel and relevant program managers. The public notice requirement in this control may be satisfied by an organization's compliance with the public notice requirements of federal laws, regulations, and guidelines, such as: Provisions of the Privacy Act,The E-Government Act's PIA requirement,OMB Memoranda including M 03-22 (Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002), 17-06 (Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services), 10-22 (Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technology), and 10-23 (Guidance for Agency Use of Third-Party Websites and Applications),The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), andThe HIPAA Privacy Rule, Section 45 CFR § 164.520, "Notice of privacy practices for protected health information."Changing PII practice or policy without prior notice is disfavored and should only be undertaken in consultation with the SOP and Chief Counsel.The website privacy policy described by OMB M-17-12, Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services, frequently referred to on organization websites as a "Privacy Policy"or "Privacy and Security Notice,"is intended as a broad notice of website privacy policies and general website use, and will not by itself meet the requirement for specific notice when collecting PII. When PII is maintained (including collection) in a system of records that is covered by the Privacy Act, the organization must provide a "Privacy Act Statement"to the individual at the time of collection that meets the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. §552a(e)(3), unless the organization has published a rule exempting that system of records from the (e)(3) notice provision in accordance with subsection (j) of the Privacy Act. If the PII is not maintained in a system of records under the Privacy Act, a privacy notice should be provided which describes the privacy practices associated with that PII, including, but not limited to, the way the PII is protected, how it is used, and whether it is shared. To avoid confusion, this type of privacy notice must not be labeled as a "Privacy Act Statement."As an alternative, several organizations refer to this notice type as a "Privacy Advisory."

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The HIPAA Privacy Rule also requires a privacy notice referred to as a "Notice of Privacy Practices."For specific rules on this notice please refer to 45 C.F.R. §164.520.

    Real-time notice facilitates informed consent and promotes trust from the individual when collecting sensitive PII. Real-time notice used in conjunction with a Privacy Act Statement or Privacy Advisory, based on the sensitivity of the PII provided or collected, ensures the individual provides informed consent.Real-time notice is defined as notice at the point of collection. A layered notice approach involves providing individuals with a summary of key points in the organization's privacy policy. A second notice provides more detailed/specific information.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    The HIPAA Privacy Rule provides the option of layered notice to allow for simplified up-front notification with greater detail following.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    SORNs and Privacy Act Statements, i.e., (e)(3) notices, provide transparency, in advance of collection, use, maintenance, or sharing of PII when in a system that meets the statutory definition of a "system of records"under the Privacy Act. The Privacy Act notes that it uses "maintain"to include "maintain, collect, use or disseminate."These requirements impact decisions made during planning, design, development, and operation of programs and systems.Organizations issue SORNs to provide the public notice regarding PII collected in a system of records, which the Privacy Act defines as "a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or another identifier."SORNs explain how the information is used, retained, and may be corrected, and whether certain portions of the system are subject to Privacy Act exemptions for law enforcement or national security reasons. Privacy Act Statements provide notice of: (i) the authority of organizations to collect PII; (ii) whether providing PII is mandatory or optional; (iii) the principal purpose(s) for which the PII is to be used; (iv) the intended disclosures (routine uses) of the information; and (v) the consequences of not providing all or some portion of the information requested. When information is collected verbally, organizations read a Privacy Act Statement prior to initiating the collection of PII (for example, when conducting telephone interviews or surveys).The Privacy Act and OMB guidance set forth specific requirements regarding when and how notices are provided. In addition to any internal organization review process, the publication of a SORN in the Federal Register requires a mandatory review and comment period of a minimum of 40 days. Regarding TR-2, paragraph a, the publication of a SORN is required only when the PII is maintained in a system that meets the statutory definition of a "system of records"under the Privacy Act. Not all systems containing PII may meet the definition of a "system of records."However, all PII maintained by an organization must be protected irrespective of whether the PII is subject to the Privacy Act.Regarding TR-2, paragraph c, the Privacy Act Statement, when required, should be provided in the same format as the information is collected. For example, an electronic statement on a website, a written statement on a paper form, and a verbal statement provided for information that is collected verbally.

  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Consistent with the Privacy Act, the organization's internal use of PII contained in a system of records notice (SORN) is limited to the purposes identified in one of the 12 exceptions to Section b of the Privacy Act and as described in the SORN. Consistent with the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPP) and Section 208 of the E-Government Act, the organization's internal use of PII not contained in a SORN should be compatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected and as described in the PIA or other public notice.Organizations take steps to ensure that they use PII only for legally authorized purposes and in a manner compatible with uses identified in the Privacy Act and/or in public notices. These steps include monitoring and auditing organizational use of PII and training organizational personnel on the authorized uses of PII. With guidance from the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) and where appropriate, legal counsel, organizations document processes and procedures for evaluating any proposed new uses of PII to assess whether they fall within the scope of the organizational authorities. Where appropriate, organizations obtain consent from individuals for the new use(s) of PII.The phrase "authorization schema"refers to the logic of how authorization permissions are designed to function within the system (e.g., by group, by role, by transaction type, etc.). An example of an authorization schema where permissions appropriately match functions would be a schema where a group of "reviewers"is separate from a group of "approvers."Individuals assigned to the "reviewer"group could read PII and make recommendations, but not approve actions. Individuals in the "approver"group could read recommendations and approve actions. An authorization schema where all individuals are automatically authorized to approve all actions is an example of a schema where the alignment between permissions and functions may be inappropriate.

      text: Consistent with the Purpose Specification and Use Limitation Fair Information
        Practice Principles (FIPPs), sharing of PII must be compatible with the purpose
        for which it was collected. Consistent with the Transparency FIPP, any subsequent
        sharing that is not compatible may not be done until additional notice is
        provided to the individual, their consent is obtained, and relevant documents
        are updated or published; e.g., when applicable and appropriate, publish an
        updated system of records notice (SORN) to cover the additional incompatible
        sharing and obtain consent from the affected individuals.
  Supplemental Guidance: |
    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):

    Sharing PII with third parties introduces new risks to the individual which, as applicable, requires organizations to establish formal agreements with the third party and to ensure the sharing is compatible with the purposes described in any notice to, and consent from, the individual. Consideration of privacy risks for sharing PII apply regardless of the method used or whether the information remains stored in the system of records. Data removed from an information system covered by a system of records notice (e.g., a Human Resources [HR] database) and shared in another format (e.g., an Excel spreadsheet) must still meet purpose and use requirements of the associated notice. PII not in a system of records that is shared with a third party still must meet the Purpose Specification and, relatedly, Use Limitation FIPPs. For example, data extracts of PII shared via an Excel spreadsheet or database archive must still be shared only if consistent with purposes set out in notices provided to the individual, and in any consent or authorization received from that individual.A "third party"for these purposes is an individual or organization other than CMS and the individual about whom CMS collects and uses information.The organization SOP and, where appropriate, legal counsel, review and approve any proposed external sharing of PII, including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for consistency with uses described in the existing organizational public notice(s). When a proposed new instance of external sharing of PII is not currently authorized by the Privacy Act and/or specified in a notice, organizations evaluate whether the proposed external sharing is compatible with the purpose(s) specified in the notice. If the proposed sharing is compatible, organizations review, update, and republish their privacy impact assessment (PIA), SORN, website privacy policies, and other public notices, if any, to include specific descriptions of the new uses(s) and obtain consent where appropriate and feasible. Information-sharing agreements also include security protections consistent with the sensitivity of the information being shared.

    Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:

    Under HIPAA Privacy Rule, a covered entity may not use, disclose or request a medical record, except when the medical record is specifically justified as the amount that is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the use, disclosure, or request.  The disclosure and sharing of PHI is governed by the HIPAA regulations. For details consult the HIPAA Privacy and Security rules at:  <http://www.hhs.gov/ocr/privacy/index.html>.
