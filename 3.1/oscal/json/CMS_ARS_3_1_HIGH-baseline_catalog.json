Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed. The organizational risk management strategy is a key factor in establishing policy and procedures.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nAccess Control policies and procedures form the foundation that allows privacy protections to be implemented for the identified uses of personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI). Privacy requirements commonly use the terms &ldquo;adequate security&rdquo; and &ldquo;confidentiality&rdquo; when referring to access controls and other security safeguards for PII. Applied together, these terms signify the need to make risk-based decisions based on the magnitude of harm (to both organizations and individuals) when determining applicable restrictions for PII. For this overlay, refer to the definitions of &ldquo;adequate security&rdquo; in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, and &ldquo;confidentiality&rdquo; in NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 1, Appendix B. These definitions are consistent with Committee for National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) No. 4009.\n"

Some of the account management requirements listed can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or CISO) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or \n\n\t\t(ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nAccount management is a critical function for developing and implementing an access control framework that is appropriate for the information contained in systems and applications. When implemented effectively, the access control framework provides the necessary constructs for controlling access to PII, limiting disclosure of records about individuals to only those system and application users that have a need for the information to perform their job functions. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user access to PHI and PII.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nThe identification of authorized users and access privileges include considerations of whether the user will need access to PHI and whether such access may be permitted or required under HIPAA. The purpose of this guidance is to establish requirements for user access to PHI. Organizations should establish procedures for obtaining necessary electronic protected health information, to include during an emergency.\n"

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); \n\n\t\t(ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and \n\n\t\t(iii) implementing trustworthy regarding mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. NIST SP 800-53 control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards. Such capabilities are generally not available in commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) information technology products.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nThe information flow enforcement controls provide a technical means of implementing disclosure requirements by minimizing information shared between networks, devices, and individuals within information systems and between interconnected systems. This control can also limit information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content.\n"

Implementing this control helps reduce the risk of inappropriate access to PII (e.g., separating employees that perform security investigations from mission and business functions).Separation of duties is implemented by designating a selected set of administrators the capability to set user permissions to PII and PHI information, while those administrators do not themselves have access to the PII and PHI. The principle of separation of duties is significant for developers as well as for operational system administrators.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nHIPAA requires the separation of duties to ensure that checks and balances are designed into the system to limit the effect of any given end user to control the entire process. Roles and responsibilities should be divided so that a single end user cannot subvert a critical process. This practice divides the tasks related to maintaining system security among different personnel such that no single individual could compromise PHI.\n"

If this banner is inconsistent with any directives, policies, regulations, or standards, notify the CMS CIO immediately.All information system computers and network devices under CMS control, prominently display the notice and consent banner immediately upon users' authentication to the system, including, but not limited to, websites, web pages where substantial personal information from the public is collected, Secure File Transfer Protocol (SFTP), Secure Shell (SSH), or other services accessed.System use notifications can be implemented using messages or warning banners displayed before individuals log in to information systems. System use notifications are used only for access via logon interfaces with human users and are not required when such human interfaces do not exist.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nSystem use notification (e.g., logon banner) does not satisfy the requirement for Privacy Act Statements or Privacy Act system of records notice, when applicable; see TR-1 and TR-2. System use notifications are the primary, interactive vehicle for notifying system users prior to accessing a system of the organization's monitoring practices and reminding users that unauthorized use is both prohibited and subject to criminal and civil penalties. The system use notification requires explicit action from the system user to acknowledge the notice before they can enter the system. Notices on system use are principally intended to convey information regarding consent to monitor (and other security-relevant information). These notices may also be, in some instances, an appropriate means to remind system users that the system being accessed contains sensitive PII and requires due care (e.g., a logon banner on an employee management system).\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nNote that System Use Notification does not satisfy the requirement for privacy notice under the HIPAA Privacy Rule.\n"

Remote access methods include, for example, dial-up, broadband, and wireless. Organizations often employ encrypted VPNs to enhance confidentiality and integrity over remote connections. The use of encrypted VPNs, does not make the access non-remote; however, the use of VPNs, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls (e.g., employing appropriate encryption techniques for confidentiality and integrity protection) may provide sufficient assurance to the organization that it can effectively treat such connections as internal networks. Still, VPN connections traverse external networks, and the encrypted VPN does not enhance the availability of remote connections. Also, VPNs with encrypted tunnels can affect the organizational capability to adequately monitor network communications traffic for malicious code. Remote access controls apply to information systems other than public web servers or systems designed for public access. This control addresses authorization prior to allowing remote access without specifying the formats for such authorization. While organizations may use interconnection security agreements to authorize remote access connections, such agreements are not required by this control.

Mobile devices may also include voice communication capabilities, on-board sensors that allow the device to capture information, and/or built-in features for synchronizing local data with remote locations. Examples include smart phones, e-readers, and tablets. Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually near the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared). Organizations are cautioned that the need to provide adequate security for mobile devices goes beyond the requirements in this control. Many safeguards and countermeasures for mobile devices are reflected in other security controls in the catalog allocated in the initial control baselines as starting points for the development of security plans and overlays using the tailoring process. There may also be some degree of overlap in the requirements articulated by the security controls within the different families of controls.

Therefore, organizations may choose to impose different security restrictions on contractors than on state, local, or tribal governments.This control does not apply to the use of external information systems to access public interfaces to organizational information systems (e.g., individuals accessing federal information through  HYPERLINK \"http://www.medicare.gov\" ). Organizations establish terms and conditions for the use of external information systems in accordance with organizational security policies and procedures. Terms and conditions address as a minimum: types of applications that can be accessed on organizational information systems from external information systems; and the highest security category of information that can be processed, stored, or transmitted on external information systems. If terms and conditions with the owners of external information systems cannot be established, organizations may impose restrictions on organizational personnel using those external systems.For some external systems, those systems operated by other federal agencies, including organizations subordinate to CMS, the trust relationships that have been established between those organizations and the originating organization may be such, that no explicit terms and conditions are required. In effect, the information systems of these organizations would not be considered external.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nAccess to PII from external information systems (including, but not limited to, personally owned information systems/devices) is reinforced by a binding agreement to terms and conditions of the organization's privacy requirements to ensure awareness and accountability of both parties.Such agreements may include memoranda of understanding (MOU), terms of service, or contracts.\n"

                "prose": "An event is any observable occurrence in an organizational information system. Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.The Federal Rules of Evidence can be found at this website: http://www.uscourts.gov/file/rules-evidence  \n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nThis control identifies privacy-relevant security auditable events using a risk-based approach. Examples of privacy-relevant auditable events include logging access to or modification of PII.The parameter values for this control do not provide an exhaustive list of all auditable events, but instead list the auditable events required by OMB privacy policy. The organization should manage the length of time that a log file is maintained to the period necessary to comply with the organization's security and privacy policies.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nThe HIPAA Security Rule requires the auditing of activity in information systems that contain PHI but does not identify the specific audit events.

Rather, the control enhancement requires that the analysis of information being otherwise produced in these areas is integrated with the analysis of audit information.

The use of standardized audit record analysis scripts developed by organizations (with localized script adjustments, as necessary) provides more cost-effective approaches for analyzing audit record information collected. The correlation of audit record information with vulnerability scanning information is important in determining the veracity of vulnerability scans and correlating attack detection events with scanning results.

Security assessments: \n\n\t\t(i) ensure that information security is built into organizational information systems; \n\n\t\t(ii) identify weaknesses and deficiencies early in the development process; \n\n\t\t(iii) provide essential information needed to make risk-based decisions as part of security authorization processes; and \n\n\t\t(iv) ensure compliance to vulnerability mitigation procedures. Assessments are conducted on the implemented security controls from NIST SP 800-53 Appendix F (main catalog) and NIST SP 800-53 Appendix G (Program Management controls) as documented in System Security Plans and Information Security Program Plans. Organizations can use other types of assessment activities such as vulnerability scanning and system monitoring to maintain the security posture of information systems during the entire life cycle. Security assessment reports document assessment results in sufficient detail as deemed necessary by CMS, to determine the accuracy and completeness of the reports and whether the security controls are implemented correctly, operating as intended, and producing the desired outcome with respect to meeting security requirements. The Federal Information Security Modernization Act (FISMA) requirement for assessing security controls at least annually does not require additional assessment activities to those activities already in place in organizational security authorization processes. Security assessment results are provided to the individuals or roles appropriate for the types of assessments being conducted. For example, assessments conducted in support of security authorization decisions are provided to authorizing officials or authorizing official designated representatives.To satisfy annual assessment requirements, organizations can use assessment results from the following sources, including but not limited to: \n\n\t\t(i) initial or ongoing information system authorizations; \n\n\t\t(ii) continuous monitoring; or \n\n\t\t(iii) system development life cycle activities. Organizations ensure that security assessment results are current, relevant to the determination of security control effectiveness; and obtained with the appropriate level of assessor independence. Existing security control assessment results can be reused to the extent that the results are still valid and can also be supplemented with additional assessments as needed.After initial authorizations and in accordance with OMB policy, organizations assess security controls during continuous monitoring. Organizations establish the security control selection criteria and subsequently selects a subset of the security controls within the information system and its environment of operation for assessment. Those security controls that are the most volatile (i.e., controls most affected by ongoing changes to the information system or its environment of operation) or deemed critical to protecting CMS operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation are assessed more frequently in accordance with an organizational assessment of risk. All other controls are assessed at least once during the information system's three-year authorization cycle. The organization can use the current year's assessment results from any of the above sources to meet the FISMA annual assessment requirement if the results are current, valid, and relevant to determining security control effectiveness. Vulnerability Alerts provide useful examples of vulnerability mitigation procedures. External audits (e.g., audits by external entities such as regulatory agencies) are outside the scope of this control.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nThis control addresses the process of planning for and executing security assessments, the scope of which should include assessment of applicable privacy requirements.Once the final security assessment is completed, update the associated Privacy Impact Assessment (PIA) to reflect the results of the security assessment.\n"

Impartiality implies that assessors are free from any perceived or actual conflicts of interest regarding the development, operation, or management of the organizational information systems under assessment or to the determination of security control effectiveness. To achieve impartiality, assessors should not: \n\n\t\t(i) create a mutual or conflicting interest with the organizations where the assessments are being conducted; \n\n\t\t(ii) assess their own work; \n\n\t\t(iii) act as management or employees of the organizations they are serving; or \n\n\t\t(iv) place themselves in positions of advocacy for the organizations acquiring their services. Independent assessments can be obtained from elements within organizations or can be contracted to public or private sector entities outside of organizations.AOs determine the required level of independence based on the security categories of information systems and/or the ultimate risk to organizational operations, organizational assets, or individuals. AOs also determine if the level of assessor independence provides sufficient assurance that the results are sound and can be used to make credible, risk-based decisions. This includes determining whether contracted security assessment services have sufficient independence, for example, when information system owners are not directly involved in contracting processes or cannot unduly influence the impartiality of assessors conducting assessments. In special situations, for example, when organizations that own the information systems are small or organizational structures require that assessments be conducted by individuals that are in the developmental, operational, or management chain of system owners; independence in assessment processes can be achieved by ensuring that assessment results are carefully reviewed and analyzed by independent teams of experts to validate the completeness, accuracy, integrity, and reliability of the results. Organizations recognize that assessments performed for purposes other than direct support to authorization decisions are, when performed by assessors with sufficient independence, more likely to be useable for such decisions, thereby reducing the need to repeat assessments.\n"

Explicit authorization to operate the information system is provided by the CMS CIO or his/her designated representative prior to a system being placed into operations. Through the security authorization process, the CMS CIO is accountable for security risks associated with the operation and use of CMS information systems.OMB policy requires that organizations conduct ongoing authorizations of information systems by implementing continuous monitoring programs. Continuous monitoring programs can satisfy three-year reauthorization requirements, so separate reauthorization processes are not necessary. Through the employment of comprehensive continuous monitoring processes, critical information contained in authorization packages (i.e., security plans, security assessment reports, and plans of action and milestones) is updated on an ongoing basis, providing the CMS CIO and information system owners with an up-to-date status of the security state of organizational information systems and environments of operation. To reduce the administrative cost of security reauthorization, the CMS CIO uses results of the continuous monitoring processes to the maximum extent possible as the basis for rendering reauthorization decisions.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nOne of the considerations for the &ldquo;go/no go&rdquo; decision when authorizing (or re-authorizing) an information system is whether applicable privacy requirements have been met.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nThe senior-level executive should be one of the following: HIPAA Security Officer, Authorizing Official, Program Manager, Information System Security Manager (ISSM), or Information System Security Officer (ISSO).\n\nGuidance for systems defined as CSPs:\n\nSignificant change is defined in NIST SP 800-37 Revision 1, Appendix F.

Continuous monitoring programs also allow organizations to maintain the security authorizations of information systems and common controls over time in highly dynamic environments of operation with changing mission/business needs, threats, vulnerabilities, and technologies. Having access to security-related information on a continuing basis through reports/dashboards gives organizational officials the capability to make more effective and timely risk management decisions, including ongoing security authorization decisions.

                "prose": "Penetration testing is a specialized type of assessment conducted on information systems or individual system components to identify vulnerabilities that could be exploited by adversaries. Such testing can be used to either validate vulnerabilities or determine the degree of resistance organizational information systems will have against adversaries within a set of specified constraints (e.g., time, resources, and/or skills). Penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of internal and external adversaries in carrying out hostile cyber-attacks against organizations and provides a more in-depth analysis of security-related weaknesses/deficiencies. Organizations can also use the results of vulnerability analyses to support penetration testing activities. Penetration testing can be conducted on the hardware, software, or firmware components of an information system and can exercise both physical and technical security controls. A standard method for penetration testing includes, for example: \n\n\t\t(i) pretest analysis based on full knowledge of the target system; \n\n\t\t(ii) pretest identification of potential vulnerabilities based on pretest analysis; and \n\n\t\t(iii) testing designed to determine exploitability of identified vulnerabilities. All parties agree to the rules of engagement before the commencement of penetration testing scenarios. Organizations correlate the penetration testing rules of engagement with the tools, techniques, and procedures that are anticipated to be employed by adversaries carrying out attacks. Organizational risk assessments guide decisions on the level of independence required for personnel conducting penetration testing. External penetration testing attempts to duplicate the actions of external adversaries (outside the security perimeter) in carrying out hostile cyber-attacks against the organization.  Internal penetration testing is performed from inside the system security perimeter. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats. All security information and results, complete and unedited, from relevant automated tools must be available to the CCIC upon their request.  The information must be made available in a format, and within a timeframe, to be agreed-upon with the CCIC and consistent with all other safeguards required by the ARS.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nWhen user session information and other PII is captured or recorded during penetration testing, ensure relevant privacy controls are addressed.\n"

Information technology products for which security-related configuration settings can be defined include, for example, mainframe computers, servers (e.g., database, electronic mail, authentication, web, proxy, file, domain name), workstations, input/output devices (e.g., scanners, copiers, and printers), network components (e.g., firewalls, routers, gateways, voice and data switches, wireless access points, network appliances, sensors), operating systems, middleware, and applications. Security-related parameters are those parameters impacting the security state of information systems including the parameters required to satisfy other security control requirements. Security-related parameters include, for example: \n\n\t\t(i) registry settings; \n\n\t\t(ii) account, file, and directory permission settings; and \n\n\t\t(iii) settings for functions, ports, protocols, services, and remote connections. Organizations establish organization-wide configuration settings and subsequently derive specific settings for information systems. The established settings become part of each system's baseline configuration.Common secure configurations (also referred to as security configuration checklists, lockdown and hardening guides, security reference guides, security technical implementation guides) provide recognized, standardized, and established benchmarks that stipulate secure configuration settings for specific information technology platforms/products and instructions for configuring those information system components to meet operational requirements. Common secure configurations can be developed by a variety of organizations including, for example, information technology product developers, manufacturers, vendors, consortia, academia, industry, federal agencies, and other organizations in the public and private sectors. Common secure configurations include the USGCB which affects the implementation of CM-6 and other controls such as AC-19 and CM-7. The Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP) and the defined standards within the protocol (e.g., Common Configuration Enumeration) provide an effective method to uniquely identify, track, and control configuration settings. OMB establishes federal policy on configuration requirements for federal information systems.Legacy operating systems without ongoing vendor support, such as Windows XP or older desktop OS, Windows Server 2003 or older server OS, Solaris 9 or older OS, or Red Hat Linux 9 or older, are only permissible if documented within the Risk Assessment and System Security Plan and authorized by the Authorizing Official (AO).\n"

Some of the functions and services, provided by default, may not be necessary to support essential organizational operations (e.g., key missions, functions). Additionally, it is sometimes convenient to provide multiple services from single information system components, but doing so increases risk over limiting the services provided by any one component. Where feasible, organizations limit component functionality to a single function per device (e.g., email servers or web servers, but not both). Organizations review functions and services provided by information systems or individual components of information systems, to determine which functions and services are candidates for elimination (e.g., VoIP, Instant Messaging, auto-execute, and file sharing). Organizations consider disabling unused or unnecessary physical and logical ports/protocols (e.g., USB, FTP, and Hypertext Transfer Protocol [HTTP]) on information systems to prevent unauthorized connection of devices, unauthorized transfer of information, or unauthorized tunneling. Organizations can utilize network scanning tools, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and end-point protections such as firewalls and host-based intrusion detection systems to identify and prevent the use of prohibited functions, ports, protocols, and services.

Contingency planning addresses both information system restoration and implementation of alternative mission/business processes when systems are impacted.  The effectiveness of contingency planning is maximized by considering such planning throughout the phases of the system development life cycle. Performing contingency planning on hardware, software, and firmware development can be an effective means of achieving information system resiliency. Contingency plans reflect the degree of restoration required for organizational information systems since not all systems may need to fully recover to achieve the level of continuity of operations desired. Information system recovery objectives reflect applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, standards, regulations, and guidelines. In addition to information system availability, contingency plans also address other security-related events resulting in a reduction in mission and/or business effectiveness, such as malicious attacks compromising the confidentiality or integrity of information systems. Actions addressed in contingency plans include, for example, orderly/graceful degradation, information system shutdown, fallback to a manual mode, alternate information flows, and operating in modes reserved for when systems are under attack. By closely coordinating contingency planning with incident handling activities, organizations can ensure that the necessary contingency planning activities are in place and activated in the event of a security incident.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nContingency plans must take privacy-applicable requirements into account so that executing contingency measures does not result in avoidable privacy incidents and breaches.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nThe contingency plan for systems containing PHI must include:  1)  Data backup plan,  2)  Disaster recovery plan,  3)  Emergency mode operation plan, and   4)  Emergency access procedures.Additionally, the decision to include the following is dependent on a risk analysis to determine if or to what extent these should be included in the contingency plan:  1)  Testing and revision procedures,  2)  Applications and data criticality analysis, and  3)  Contingency operations (i.e., procedures that allow facility access in support of restoration of lost data.\n"

Recovery/reconstitution capabilities employed by organizations can include both automated mechanisms and manual procedures.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nInformation system recovery and reconstitution is an important step to restoring sensitive information, such as both personally identifiable information (PII) and protected health information (PHI), to an accurate state following execution of a contingency plan.\n"

This control applies to all accesses other than: \n\n\t\t(i) accesses that are explicitly identified and documented in AC-14; and \n\n\t\t(ii) accesses that occur through authorized use of group authenticators without individual authentication. Organizations may require unique identification of individuals in group accounts (e.g., shared privilege accounts) or for detailed accountability of individual activity. Organizations employ passwords, tokens, or biometrics to authenticate user identities, or in the case of multifactor authentication, some combination thereof. Access to organizational information systems is defined as either local access or network access. Local access is any access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained by direct connections without the use of networks. Network access is access to organizational information systems by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) where such access is obtained through network connections (i.e., nonlocal accesses). Remote access is a type of network access that involves communication through external networks (e.g., the Internet). Internal networks include local area networks and wide area networks. In addition, the use of encrypted VPNs for network connections between organization-controlled endpoints and non-organization controlled endpoints may be treated as internal networks from the perspective of protecting the confidentiality and integrity of information traversing the network.Organizations can satisfy the identification and authentication requirements in this control by complying with the requirements in Homeland Security Presidential Directive 12 consistent with the specific organizational implementation plans. Multifactor authentication requires the use of two or more different factors to achieve authentication. The factors are defined as: \n\n\t\t(i) something you know (e.g., password, personal identification number [PIN]); \n\n\t\t(ii) something you have (e.g., cryptographic identification device, token); or \n\n\t\t(iii) something you are (e.g., a biometric identifier). Multifactor solutions that require devices separate from information systems gaining access include, for example, hardware tokens providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government PIV card and the Department of Defense (DoD) common access card. In addition to identifying and authenticating users at the information system level (i.e., at logon), organizations also employ identification and authentication mechanisms at the application level, when necessary, to provide increased information security. Identification and authentication requirements for other than organizational users are described in IA-8.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nImplementing this control ensures unique identification of an individual's account, preventing anonymous access to sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) and providing appropriate access (e.g., where there is a need for the PII in the performance of the user's official duties) for organizational users.

Multifactor solutions that feature physical authenticators include, for example, hardware authenticators providing time-based or challenge-response authenticators and smart cards such as the U.S. Government Personal Identity Verification card or the DoD common access card. In addition to authenticating users at the system level, organizations may also employ authentication mechanisms at the application level, at their discretion, to provide increased information security.

Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately.

Digital media includes, for example, diskettes, magnetic tapes, external/removable hard disk drives, flash drives, compact disks, and digital video disks. Non-digital media includes, for example, paper and microfilm. This control also applies to mobile devices with information storage capability (e.g., smart phones, tablets, E-readers), that are transported outside of controlled areas. Controlled areas are areas or spaces for which organizations provide sufficient physical and/or procedural safeguards to meet the requirements established for protecting information and/or information systems.Physical and technical safeguards for media are commensurate with the security category or classification of the information residing on the media. Safeguards to protect media during transport include, for example, locked containers and cryptography. Cryptographic mechanisms can provide confidentiality and integrity protections depending upon the mechanisms used. Activities associated with transport include the actual transport as well as those activities such as releasing media for transport and ensuring that media enters the appropriate transport processes. For the actual transport, authorized transport and courier personnel may include individuals from outside the organization (e.g., U.S. Postal Service or a commercial transport or delivery service). Maintaining accountability of media during transport includes, for example, restricting transport activities to authorized personnel and tracking and/or obtaining explicit records of transport activities as the media moves through the transportation system to prevent and detect loss, destruction, or tampering. Organizations establish documentation requirements for activities associated with the transport of information system media in accordance with organizational assessments of risk to include the flexibility to define different record-keeping methods for the different types of media transport as part of an overall system of transport-related records.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nProtecting and controlling media containing sensitive information, such as PII, commensurate with the sensitivity of the information contained on the media, during transport outside of controlled areas, promotes accountability and limits situations that make the media vulnerable to unauthorized use and disclosure through loss, theft, or other mishandling.\n"

Individuals (e.g., employees, contractors, and others) with permanent physical access authorization credentials are not considered visitors. Organizations determine the types of facility guards needed, including, for example, professional physical security staff or other personnel such as administrative staff or information system users. Physical access devices include, for example, keys, locks, combinations, and card readers. Safeguards for publicly accessible areas within organizational facilities include, for example, cameras, monitoring by guards, and isolating selected information systems and/or system components in secured areas. Physical access control systems comply with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance. The Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management (FICAM) Program provides implementation guidance for identity, credential, and access management capabilities for physical access control systems. Organizations have flexibility in the types of audit logs employed. Audit logs can be procedural (e.g., a written log of individuals accessing the facility and when such access occurred), automated (e.g., capturing ID provided by a PIV card), or some combination thereof. Physical access points can include facility access points, interior access points to information systems and/or components requiring supplemental access controls, or both. Components of organizational information systems (e.g., workstations, terminals) may be in areas designated as publicly accessible with organizations safeguarding access to such devices.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nEmploying physical access controls that limit access to a facility that are commensurate with the level of sensitivity of the information processed in a facility protects the information from unauthorized access, use, and disclosure.\n"

Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and control enhancements meet those security requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in NIST 800-53 Appendix D and Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). NIST 800-53 Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays.Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by reference sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.All CMS information systems and major applications are covered by a security plan, which is compliant with current CMS procedures.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nThe SSP is necessary for the information system to be authorized.

The information security architecture at the individual information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and any other specific protection needs.In today's modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers (to include CSPs). Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development). SA-17, which is complementary to PL-8, is selected when organizations outsource the development of information systems or information system components to external entities, and there is a need to demonstrate/show consistency with the organization's enterprise architecture and information security architecture.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nThe information security architecture identifies security and privacy controls necessary to support privacy requirements. The SAOP or CPO are the best resource for identifying privacy requirements and privacy controls.\n"

Risk assessments also consider risk from external parties (e.g., service providers, contractors operating information systems on behalf of the organization, individuals accessing organizational information systems, outsourcing entities). In accordance with OMB policy and related E-authentication initiatives, authentication of public users accessing federal information systems may also be required to protect nonpublic or privacy-related information. As such, organizational assessments of risk also address public access to federal information systems.Risk assessments (either formal or informal) can be conducted at all three tiers in the risk management hierarchy (i.e., organization level, mission/business process level, or information system level) and at any phase in the system development life cycle. Risk assessments can also be conducted at various steps in the Risk Management Framework, including categorization, security control selection, security control implementation, security control assessment, information system authorization, and security control monitoring. RA-3 is noteworthy in that the control must be partially implemented prior to the implementation of other controls to complete the first two steps in the Risk Management Framework. Risk assessments can play an important role in security control selection processes, particularly during the application of tailoring guidance, which includes security control supplementation.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nA standardized risk assessment process should include a consideration of risks associated with the collection, maintenance, and use of sensitive information such as PII.

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: \n\n\t\t(i) scanning for patch levels; \n\n\t\t(ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and \n\n\t\t(iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms. Organizations consider using tools that express vulnerabilities in the Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) naming convention and that use the Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL) to determine/test for the presence of vulnerabilities. Suggested sources for vulnerability information include the Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) listing and the National Vulnerability Database (NVD). In addition, security control assessments such as red team exercises provide other sources of potential vulnerabilities for which to scan. Organizations also consider using tools that express vulnerability impact by the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS).The organization remediates vulnerabilities based on the Business Owner's risk prioritization in accordance with the guidance defined under security control SI-02.Penetration testing is covered under CA-08. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats.\n"

To apply the required security controls within the system development life cycle requires a basic understanding of information security, threats, vulnerabilities, adverse impacts, and risk to critical missions/business functions. The security engineering principles in SA-8 cannot be properly applied if individuals that design, code, and test information systems and system components (including information technology products) do not understand security. Therefore, organizations include qualified personnel, for example, chief information security officers, security architects, security engineers, and information system security officers in system development life cycle activities to ensure that security requirements are incorporated into organizational information systems. It is equally important that developers include individuals on the development team that possess the requisite security expertise and skills to ensure that needed security capabilities are effectively integrated into the information system. Security awareness and training programs can help ensure that individuals having key security roles and responsibilities have the appropriate experience, skills, and expertise to conduct assigned system development life cycle activities. The effective integration of security requirements into enterprise architecture also helps to ensure that important security considerations are addressed early in the system development life cycle and that those considerations are directly related to the organizational mission/business processes. This process also facilitates the integration of the information security architecture into the enterprise architecture, consistent with organizational risk management and information security strategies.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nTo ensure that privacy and security controls are appropriately considered during each phase of the SDLC, both the security and privacy offices should have a clear understanding of the requirements to protect PII.

Security documentation requirements address all phases of the system development life cycle.Security functionality, assurance, and documentation requirements are expressed in terms of security controls and control enhancements that have been selected through the tailoring process. The security control tailoring process includes, for example, the specification of parameter values using assignment and selection statements and the specification of platform dependencies and implementation information. Security documentation provides user and administrator guidance regarding the implementation and operation of security controls. The level of detail required in security documentation is based on the security category or classification level of the information system and the degree to which organizations depend on the stated security capability, functions, or mechanisms to meet overall risk response expectations (as defined in the organizational risk management strategy). Security requirements can also include organizationally mandated configuration settings specifying allowed functions, ports, protocols, and services.

This includes services that are used by, but not a part of, organizational information systems. FISMA and OMB policy require that organizations using external service providers that are processing, storing, or transmitting federal information or operating information systems on behalf of the Federal Government ensure that such providers meet the same security requirements that federal agencies are required to meet. Organizations establish relationships with external service providers in a variety of ways including, for example, through joint ventures, business partnerships, contracts, interagency agreements, lines of business arrangements, licensing agreements, and supply chain exchanges. The responsibility for managing risks from the use of external information system services remains with authorizing officials. For services that are external to organizations, a chain of trust requires that organizations establish and retain a level of confidence that each participating provider in the potentially complex consumer-provider relationship provides adequate protection for the services rendered. The extent and nature of this chain of trust varies based on the relationships between organizations and the external providers. Organizations document the basis for trust relationships so the relationships can be monitored over time. External information system services documentation includes government, service providers, end user security roles and responsibilities, and service-level agreements. Service-level agreements define expectations of performance for security controls, describe measurable outcomes, and identify remedies and response requirements for identified instances of noncompliance.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nThe information security requirements and controls are documented through a written contract, or other arrangement that meets the requirements of 45 C.F.R. &sect;164.314\n\n\t\t(a).

Protection of organizational information systems is accomplished through threat awareness, by the identification, management, and reduction of vulnerabilities at each phase of the life cycle and the use of complementary, mutually reinforcing strategies to respond to risk. Organizations consider implementing a standardized process to address supply chain risk with respect to information systems and system components, and to educate the acquisition workforce on threats, risk, and required security controls. Organizations use the acquisition/procurement processes to require supply chain entities to implement necessary security safeguards to: \n\n\t\t(i) reduce the likelihood of unauthorized modifications at each stage in the supply chain; and \n\n\t\t(ii) protect information systems and information system components, prior to taking delivery of such systems/components. This control enhancement also applies to information system services. Security safeguards include, for example: \n\n\t\t(i) security controls for development systems, development facilities, and external connections to development systems; \n\n\t\t(ii) vetting development personnel; and \n\n\t\t(iii) use of tamper-evident packaging during shipping/warehousing. Methods for reviewing and protecting development plans, evidence, and documentation are commensurate with the security category or classification level of the information system.

For non-kernel code, security function isolation is often achieved through file system protections that serve to protect the code on disk and address space protections that protect executing code. Information systems restrict access to security functions using access control mechanisms and by implementing least privilege capabilities.

Split tunneling might be desirable by remote users to communicate with local information system resources such as printers/file servers. However, split tunneling would in effect allow unauthorized external connections, making the system more vulnerable to attack and to exfiltration of organizational information. The use of VPN for remote connections, when adequately provisioned with appropriate security controls, may provide the organization with sufficient assurance that it can effectively treat such connections as non-remote connections from the confidentiality and integrity perspective.

Information at rest refers to the state of information when it is located on storage devices as specific components of information systems. System-related information requiring protection includes, for example, configurations or rule sets for firewalls, gateways, intrusion detection/prevention systems, filtering routers, and authenticator content. Organizations may employ different mechanisms to achieve confidentiality and integrity protections, including the use of cryptographic mechanisms and file share scanning. Integrity protection can be achieved, for example, by implementing Write-Once-Read-Many (WORM) technologies. Organizations may also employ other security controls including, for example, secure off-line storage in lieu of online storage when adequate protection of information at rest cannot otherwise be achieved and/or continuous monitoring to identify malicious code at rest.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nBecause of the sensitivity of PII and protected health information (PHI), the confidentiality and integrity of such information must be assured for data at rest.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nUnder the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification.

Flaw remediation actions that can be tracked and verified include, for example, determining whether organizations follow United States Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT) guidance and Information Assurance Vulnerability Alerts. Organization-defined time periods for updating security-relevant software and firmware may vary based on a variety of factors, including, for example, the security category of the information system or the criticality of the update (i.e., severity of the vulnerability related to the discovered flaw). Some types of flaw remediation may require more testing than other types. Organizations determine the degree and type of testing needed for the specific type of flaw remediation activity under consideration and the types of changes that are to be configuration-managed. In some situations, organizations may determine that the testing of software and/or firmware updates are not necessary or practical.

Malicious code includes, for example, viruses, worms, Trojan horses, and spyware. Malicious code can also be encoded in various formats (e.g., UUENCODE, Unicode), contained within compressed or hidden files, or hidden in files using steganography. Malicious code can be transported by different means, including, for example, web accesses, electronic mail, electronic mail attachments, and portable storage devices. Malicious code insertions occur through the exploitation of information system vulnerabilities. Malicious code protection mechanisms include, for example, anti-virus signature definitions and reputation-based technologies. A variety of technologies and methods exist to limit or eliminate the effects of malicious code. Pervasive configuration management and comprehensive software integrity controls may be effective in preventing execution of unauthorized code. In addition to commercial off-the-shelf software, malicious code may also be present in custom-built software. This could include, for example, logic bombs, back doors, and other types of cyber-attacks that could affect organizational missions/business functions. Traditional malicious code protection mechanisms cannot always detect such code. In these situations, organizations rely instead on other safeguards, including, for example, secure coding practices, configuration management and control, trusted procurement processes, and monitoring practices to help ensure that software does not perform functions other than the functions intended. Organizations may determine that in response to the detection of malicious code, different actions may be warranted. For example, organizations can define actions in response to malicious code detection during periodic scans, actions in response to detection of malicious downloads, and/or actions in response to detection of maliciousness when attempting to open or execute files.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nMalicious code protections are essential in system with PHI because of the sensitivity and desirability of such information.Under the HIPAA Security Rule, this is an addressable implementation specification. HIPAA covered entities must conduct an analysis as described at 45 C.F.R. &sect; 164.306 (Security standards: General rules) part (d) (Implementation specifications) to determine how it must be applied within the organization.\n"

                "prose": "Information system monitoring includes external and internal monitoring. External monitoring includes the observation of events occurring at the information system boundary (i.e., part of perimeter defense and boundary protection). Internal monitoring includes the observation of events occurring within the information system. Organizations can monitor information systems, for example, by observing audit activities in real-time or by observing other system aspects such as access patterns, characteristics of access, and other actions. The monitoring objectives may guide determination of the events. Information system monitoring capability is achieved through a variety of tools and techniques (e.g., intrusion detection systems, intrusion prevention systems, malicious code protection software, scanning tools, audit record monitoring software, network monitoring software). Strategic locations for monitoring devices include, for example, selected perimeter locations and near server farms supporting critical applications, with such devices typically being employed at the managed interfaces associated with controls SC-7 and AC-17. Einstein network monitoring devices from DHS can also be included as monitoring devices. The granularity of monitoring information collected is based on organizational monitoring objectives and the capability of information systems to support such objectives. Specific types of transactions of interest include, for example, HTTP traffic that bypasses HTTP proxies. Information system monitoring is an integral part of organizational continuous monitoring and incident response programs. Output from system monitoring serves as input to continuous monitoring and incident response programs. A network connection is any connection with a device that communicates through a network (e.g., local area network, Internet). A remote connection is any connection with a device communicating through an external network (e.g., the Internet). Local, network, and remote connections can be either wired or wireless.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nIntrusion-monitoring tools may collect personally identifiable information (PII) of all types. Notice to users who are monitored should be provided prior to system use. Controls sufficient to protect the type of PII collected must be in place for the technology performing the monitoring, including encryption of monitoring data that may contain PII. When conducting information system monitoring on internal or external networks which may collect PII, the organization should coordinate with the organization's counsel and privacy officer.\n"

Software applications typically follow well-defined protocols that use structured messages (i.e., commands or queries) to communicate between software modules or system components. Structured messages can contain raw or unstructured data interspersed with metadata or control information. If software applications use attacker-supplied inputs to construct structured messages without properly encoding such messages, then the attacker could insert malicious commands or special characters that can cause the data to be interpreted as control information or metadata. Consequently, the module or component that receives the tainted output will perform the wrong operations or otherwise interpret the data incorrectly. Prescreening inputs prior to passing to interpreters prevents the content from being unintentionally interpreted as commands. Input validation helps to ensure accurate and correct inputs and prevent attacks such as cross-site scripting and a variety of injection attacks.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nInformation input validation serves two important purposes for protecting PII:  (1) When PII is entered, validation techniques support data quality measures (e.g., ensuring the PII entered is the expected type and format of data); and  (2) It provides the capability to limit or exclude PII from being entered within a field (e.g., recognizing a restricted format, such as an SSN) that should not contain the PII.\n"

For PM-7, the information security architecture is developed at a system-of-systems level (organization-wide), representing all the organizational information systems. For PL-8, the information security architecture is developed at a level representing an individual information system, but at the same time is consistent with the information security architecture defined for the organization. Security requirements and security control integration are most effectively accomplished through the application of the Risk Management Framework and supporting security standards and guidelines. The Federal Segment Architecture Methodology provides guidance on integrating information security requirements and security controls into enterprise architectures.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nReference the FEA Security and Privacy Profile for additional information.\n"

The standards and guidelines that apply to insider threat programs in classified environments can also be employed effectively to improve the security of Controlled Unclassified Information in non-national security systems. Insider threat programs include security controls to detect and prevent malicious insider activity through the centralized integration and analysis of both technical and non-technical information to identify potential insider threat concerns. A senior organizational official is designated by the department/agency head as the responsible individual to implement and provide oversight for the program. In addition to the centralized integration and analysis capability, insider threat programs as a minimum, prepare department/agency insider threat policies and implementation plans, conduct host-based user monitoring of individual employee activities on government-owned classified computers, provide insider threat awareness training to employees, receive access to information from all offices within the department/agency (e.g., human resources, legal, physical security, personnel security, information technology, information system security, and law enforcement) for insider threat analysis, and conduct self-assessments of department/agency insider threat posture.Insider threat programs can leverage the existence of incident handling teams that organizations may already have in place, such as computer security incident response teams. Human resources records are especially important in this effort, as there is compelling evidence to show that some types of insider crimes are often preceded by nontechnical behaviors in the workplace (e.g., ongoing patterns of disgruntled behavior and conflicts with coworkers and other colleagues). These precursors can better inform and guide organizational officials in more focused, targeted monitoring efforts. The participation of a legal team is important to ensure that all monitoring activities are performed in accordance with appropriate legislation, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidelines.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nThe privacy risks inherent with aggregating sensitive personally identifiable information (PII) from multiple data resources within an organization, such as human resource and background investigation information, and the potential for scope creep require the active participation, review, and concurrence of the Privacy Officer.\n"

Threat information sharing may be bilateral (e.g., government-commercial cooperatives, government-government cooperatives), or multilateral (e.g., organizations taking part in threat-sharing consortia).

To maximize organizational compliance with privacy requirements and best practices, the organization should ensure its privacy professionals engage with both its security community and the Federal privacy community to remain current and to share lessons-learned or other privacy-related information.The development and implementation of a comprehensive governance and privacy program demonstrates organizational accountability for and commitment to the protection of individual privacy. Accountability begins with the appointment of a SOP with the authority, mission, resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy program. The SOP, in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and others as appropriate: \n\n\t\t(i) ensures the development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy policies and procedures; \n\n\t\t(ii) defines roles and responsibilities for protecting PII; \n\n\t\t(iii) determines the level of information sensitivity with regard to PII holdings; \n\n\t\t(iv) identifies the laws, regulations, and internal policies that apply to the PII; \n\n\t\t(v) monitors privacy best practices; and \n\n\t\t(vi) monitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls.To further accountability, the SOP develops privacy plans to document the privacy requirements of organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and supports resource requests by the SOP. A single plan or multiple plans may be necessary depending upon the organizational structures, requirements, and resources, and the plan(s) may vary in comprehensiveness. For example, a one-page privacy plan may cover privacy policies, documentation, and controls already in place, such as Privacy Impact Assessments (PIA) and System of Records Notices (SORN). A comprehensive plan may include a baseline of privacy controls selected from this appendix and include: \n\n\t\t(i) processes for conducting privacy risk assessments; \n\n\t\t(ii) templates and guidance for completing PIAs and SORNs; \n\n\t\t(iii) privacy training and awareness requirements; \n\n\t\t(iv) requirements for contractors processing PII; \n\n\t\t(v) plans for eliminating unnecessary PII holdings; and \n\n\t\t(vi) a framework for measuring annual performance goals and objectives for implementing identified privacy controls.Ongoing contact with privacy groups and associations is of paramount importance in an environment of rapidly changing technologies and threats. Privacy groups and associations include, for example, special interest groups, forums, professional associations, news groups, and/or peer groups of privacy professionals in similar organizations. Organizations select groups and associations based on organizational missions/business functions. Organizations share threat, vulnerability, and incident information consistent with applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, standards, and guidance.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nHIPAA requires policies, procedures, and personnel designations to be documented and for organizations to monitor changes in law.\n"

                "prose": "Effective implementation of privacy risk management processes requires both organizational and information system processes across the life cycle of the organization's mission, business processes, and information systems. Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) are structured reviews (qualitative and quantitative) of both the risk and effect of how information is handled and maintained as well as the potential impacts or harms to individuals and organizations for loss of control or mishandling of the PII. The term &ldquo;PIA&rdquo; may refer to the process of conducting such an assessment, or the document produced as a result of that assessment. A PIA-like process benefits an organization and the individuals whose PII is in the information system by enabling the organization to identify, evaluate, and manage the privacy risks for the PII in that system.Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The tools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. Such tools include, but are not limited to, conducting PIAs. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on the timing for developing PIAs for information systems and electronic collections of information. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and are updated when changes create new privacy risks.Information system privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycle of an information system collecting, using, maintaining, and/or disseminating PII. Such privacy risk management processes include, but are not limited to, design requirements, privacy threshold analysis, privacy impact assessments (PIA), and implementation of secure disposition. While Section 208 of the E-Government Act does not require  &mdash;  or prohibit  &mdash;  a PIA for a national security system (NSS), as defined at 40 U.S.C. &sect;11103 (see Section 202(i) of the E-Government Act), an organization may benefit from conducting a PIA or similar privacy risk evaluation on NSS as part of their internal risk management process to ensure privacy risks are identified, evaluated, and managed in information systems containing PII. For this reason, the ARS extends the requirement to develop a PIA to all information systems.\n"

Implementation of this control enables organizations to automate application of privacy controls. One simple example, which many organizations have already implemented, is TR-1, &ldquo;Privacy Notice.&rdquo; This concept is one part of the most commonly recognized approaches to &ldquo;building privacy in,&rdquo; which is sometimes also known as &ldquo;Privacy by Design.&rdquo; Privacy by Design is an internationally accepted privacy best practice endorsed by the Federal Trade Commission in their March 2012 Final Report, &ldquo;Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: Recommendations for Businesses and Policymakers,&rdquo; and embodies the same principles of the Privacy Act and Section 208 of the E-Government Act requiring privacy protections and safeguards before establishing or operating a system that may contain PII. Privacy by Design calls for considering privacy risks in the design and management of information systems. In addition to building in security and privacy controls discussed throughout the ARS, this control considers additional privacy-specific system characteristics and controls that must be built into the system to address privacy risks.To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems, organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building privacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII, thereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization's privacy policy. Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in a manner compatible with those purposes.Additional guidance on privacy-enhanced design and development may be found in the HHS Enterprise Performance Lifecycle (EPLC). Regardless of the systems engineering lifecycle used, privacy requirements should be considered during system design and development and validated and verified along with other system requirements. Validation ensures the correct requirements were identified. Verification ensures the requirements were implemented correctly.\n"

The minimum set of PII elements required to support a specific organization's business process may be a subset of the PII the organization is authorized to collect. Program officials and program representatives such as Data Guardians consult with the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) and legal counsel to identify the minimum PII elements required by the information system or activity to accomplish the legally authorized purpose.Organizations can further reduce their privacy and security risks by also reducing their inventory of PII, where appropriate. OMB Memorandum 07-16 requires organizations to conduct both an initial review and subsequent reviews of their holdings of all PII and ensure, to the maximum extent practicable, that such holdings are accurate, relevant, timely, and complete. Organizations are also directed by OMB to reduce their holdings to the minimum necessary for the proper performance of a documented organizational business purpose. OMB Memorandum 17-12 requires organizations to develop and publicize, either through a notice in the Federal Register or on their websites, a schedule for periodic reviews of their holdings to supplement the initial review. Organizations coordinate with their federal records officers to ensure that reductions in organizational holdings of PII are consistent with NARA retention schedules.Organizations should coordinate the PII holdings reviews with the systems' annual information security reviews schedule to the maximum extent practicable.By performing periodic evaluations, organizations reduce risk, ensure that they are collecting only the data specified in the notice, and ensure that the data collected is still relevant and necessary for the purpose(s) specified in the notice.\n"

NARA may require organizations to retain PII longer than is operationally needed. In those situations, organizations describe such requirements in the notice. Methods of storage include, for example, electronic, optical media (such as CDs or DVDs), or paper.Examples of ways organizations may reduce holdings include reducing the types of PII held (e.g., delete Social Security Numbers if their use is no longer needed) or shortening the retention period for PII that is maintained if it is no longer necessary to keep PII for long periods of time (this effort is undertaken in consultation with an organization's records officer to receive NARA approval). In both examples, organizations provide notice (e.g., an updated System of Records Notice) to inform the public of any changes in holdings of PII.Certain read-only archiving techniques, such as DVDs, CDs, microfilm, or microfiche may not permit the removal of individual records without the destruction of the entire database contained on such media.\n"

For specific details on those two methods see 45 C.F.R. &sect;164.514\n\n\t\t(a).  The second requirement is commonly referred to as the &ldquo;Minimum Necessary Rule&rdquo; which limits the amount of PHI used or disclosed to that which is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the request for information is made.  See 45 &sect;C.F.R. &sect;164.514(d).  The third requirement allows covered entities to use or disclose a &ldquo;limited data set&rdquo;, which excludes certain direct identifiers.  Unlike de-identified data, a limited data set is PHI and any use or disclosure must meet specific requirements set out on the HIPAA Privacy Rule. See 45 C.F.R. &sect;164.514(e).\n"

Organizations achieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated public notices.Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied consent. Opt-in consent is the preferred method, but it is not always feasible. Opt-in requires that individuals take affirmative action to allow organizations to collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an individual to click a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In contrast, opt-out requires individuals to act to prevent the new or continued collection or use of such PII. For example, the Federal Trade Commission's Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals to opt-out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list. Implied consent is the least preferred method and should be used only in limited circumstances. Implied consent occurs where individuals' behavior or failure to object indicates agreement with the collection or use of PII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has been posted that security cameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video recording). Depending upon the nature of the program or information system, it may be appropriate to allow individuals to limit the types of PII they provide and subsequent uses of that PII. Organizational consent mechanisms include a discussion of the consequences to individuals of failure to provide PII. Consequences can vary from organization to organization.Whenever feasible, opt-in is the preferred method to obtain consent.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nConsent is a term under HIPAA with specific meaning not equivalent to a HIPAA authorization.  For example, see: Uses and disclosures to carry out treatment, payment, or health care operations (45 C.F.R. &sect;164.506); Uses and Disclosures for Which an Authorization is Required (45 C.F.R. &sect;164.508); Uses and Disclosures Requiring an Opportunity to Agree/Object (45 C.F.R. &sect;164.510); Right to Request Privacy Protection for Protected Health Information (45 C.F.R. &sect;164.522).\n"

The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, requires organizations to provide mechanisms for individuals to gain access to their PII when that PII meets the definition of a &ldquo;record.&rdquo; Access is also an important aspect of supporting correction of PII and redress against alleged violations and misuse of their PII. In addition to access requirements under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, HIPAA has statutory requirements to provide access to PHI.Access affords individuals the ability to review PII about them held within organizational systems of records. Access includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to data. Organizational processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal requirements, or other factors. The Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) working with the Privacy Act Officer is responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request processing, in consultation with legal counsel. Access to certain types of records may not be appropriate, however, and heads of agencies may promulgate rules exempting systems from the access provision of the Privacy Act. For example, individuals are not entitled to access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. For other examples where agencies may promulgate rules exempting systems from the access provision, see the Privacy Act at 5 USC &sect; 552a, subsections \n\n\t\t(j) (General Exemptions) and \n\n\t\t(k) (Specific Exemptions).Organizations must provide for public access to records, including PII not included in a Privacy Act System of Records, where required or appropriate. While the language of this control is specific to the Privacy Act's requirements for access, FIPPs encourage organizations to use available authorities to provide access when the Privacy Act does not apply. For example, some organizations use the Freedom of Information Act as another tool to provide access to PII for an affected individual.\n"

The organization privacy incident and breach response capability must be able to demonstrate knowledge of the privacy incident and breach response processes and procedures and evidence showing the plan is followed routinely while responding to privacy incidents and breaches.In contrast to the Incident Response (IR) family in NIST 800-53 Appendix F, which concerns a broader range of incidents affecting information security, this control uses the term Privacy Incident to describe only those incidents that relate to personally identifiable information (PII). The organization Privacy Incident Response Plan is developed under the leadership of the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP). The plan includes: \n\n\t\t(i) The establishment of a cross-functional Privacy Incident Response Team that reviews, approves, and participates in the execution of the Privacy Incident Response Plan; \n\n\t\t(ii) A process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and to provide that notice accordingly; \n\n\t\t(iii) A privacy risk assessment process to determine the extent of harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals and, where appropriate, to take steps to mitigate any such risks; \n\n\t\t(iv) Internal procedures to ensure prompt reporting by employees and contractors of any privacy incident to the SOP and other designated officials consistent with organizational incident management structures; and \n\n\t\t(v) Internal procedures for reporting noncompliance with organizational privacy policy by employees or contractors to appropriate management or oversight officials. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to provide notice to oversight organizations in the event of a breach.Organizations may also choose to integrate Privacy Incident Response Plans with Security Incident Response Plans or keep the plans separate.The Best Judgment Standard, explained in OMB M-17-12, Footnote 6, imposes a requirement for organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. The Best Judgment Standard gives organizations responsibility for their own data in two important ways. First, the organization must determine the sensitivity of its PII, based on the information and the context in which the information appears. Second, the organization must determine whether a privacy breach should be reported, based on the resultant privacy risk to the organization and to affected individuals. The Best Judgment Standard effectively imposes a requirement on organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. In the context of breach reporting, the purpose of the Best Judgment Standard is to limit reporting to those privacy breaches which meet the organization's risk threshold. Conversely, under the Best Judgment Standard, organizations are not required to report privacy breaches that do not meet their risk threshold. The policy provides an example of implementing the Best Judgment Standard as discarding a document with the author's name on the front and no other PII into an office trashcan, positing that this probably would fall below and organization's risk threshold and would not need to be reported. OMB M-17-12 does not provide bright line rules to define what is considered &ldquo;sensitive PII&rdquo; using the common dictionary definition approach to the language in the memorandum -and under what circumstances a privacy breach should be reported, both because it would be a futile effort to attempt to delineate or predict the myriad potential contexts and situations, and agencies are in the best position to know and understand the relevant circumstances of their PII to determine which PII is sensitive and which breaches create risk.\n"

                "prose": "Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\n\nProviding the appropriate notification of privacy practices to the individual enables the individual to make an informed decision when they provide their consent.Effective notice, by virtue of its clarity, readability, and comprehensiveness, enables individuals to understand how an organization uses PII generally and, where appropriate, to make an informed decision prior to providing PII to an organization. Effective notice also demonstrates the privacy considerations that the organization has addressed in implementing its information practices. The organization may provide public notice through a variety of means. Some of these may be required by law or regulations, such as system of records notices (SORN) for Privacy Act systems, privacy impact assessments (PIA) for agency information systems and electronic collections of information, and website privacy policies for agency websites. As required by the Privacy Act, the organization also provides direct notice to individuals via Privacy Act Statements on the paper and electronic forms it uses to collect PII, or on separate forms that can be retained by the individuals.The Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) is responsible for the content of the organization's public notices, in consultation with legal counsel and relevant program managers. The public notice requirement in this control may be satisfied by an organization's compliance with the public notice requirements of federal laws, regulations, and guidelines, such as: Provisions of the Privacy Act,The E-Government Act's PIA requirement,OMB Memoranda including M 03-22 (Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002), 17-06 (Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services), 10-22 (Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technology), and 10-23 (Guidance for Agency Use of Third-Party Websites and Applications),The Children's Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), andThe HIPAA Privacy Rule, Section 45 CFR &sect; 164.520, &ldquo;Notice of privacy practices for protected health information.&rdquo; Changing PII practice or policy without prior notice is disfavored and should only be undertaken in consultation with the SOP and Chief Counsel.The website privacy policy described by OMB M-17-12, Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services, frequently referred to on organization websites as a &ldquo;Privacy Policy&rdquo; or &ldquo;Privacy and Security Notice,&rdquo; is intended as a broad notice of website privacy policies and general website use, and will not by itself meet the requirement for specific notice when collecting PII. When PII is maintained (including collection) in a system of records that is covered by the Privacy Act, the organization must provide a &ldquo;Privacy Act Statement&rdquo; to the individual at the time of collection that meets the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. &sect;552a(e)(3), unless the organization has published a rule exempting that system of records from the (e)(3) notice provision in accordance with subsection \n\n\t\t(j) of the Privacy Act. If the PII is not maintained in a system of records under the Privacy Act, a privacy notice should be provided which describes the privacy practices associated with that PII, including, but not limited to, the way the PII is protected, how it is used, and whether it is shared. To avoid confusion, this type of privacy notice must not be labeled as a &ldquo;Privacy Act Statement.&rdquo; As an alternative, several organizations refer to this notice type as a &ldquo;Privacy Advisory.&rdquo;\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule also requires a privacy notice referred to as a &ldquo;Notice of Privacy Practices.&rdquo; For specific rules on this notice please refer to 45 C.F.R. &sect;164.520.\n"

The Privacy Act notes that it uses &ldquo;maintain&rdquo; to include &ldquo;maintain, collect, use or disseminate.&rdquo; These requirements impact decisions made during planning, design, development, and operation of programs and systems.Organizations issue SORNs to provide the public notice regarding PII collected in a system of records, which the Privacy Act defines as &ldquo;a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or another identifier.&rdquo; SORNs explain how the information is used, retained, and may be corrected, and whether certain portions of the system are subject to Privacy Act exemptions for law enforcement or national security reasons. Privacy Act Statements provide notice of: \n\n\t\t(i) the authority of organizations to collect PII; \n\n\t\t(ii) whether providing PII is mandatory or optional; \n\n\t\t(iii) the principal purpose(s) for which the PII is to be used; \n\n\t\t(iv) the intended disclosures (routine uses) of the information; and \n\n\t\t(v) the consequences of not providing all or some portion of the information requested. When information is collected verbally, organizations read a Privacy Act Statement prior to initiating the collection of PII (for example, when conducting telephone interviews or surveys).The Privacy Act and OMB guidance set forth specific requirements regarding when and how notices are provided. In addition to any internal organization review process, the publication of a SORN in the Federal Register requires a mandatory review and comment period of a minimum of 40 days. Regarding TR-2, paragraph a, the publication of a SORN is required only when the PII is maintained in a system that meets the statutory definition of a &ldquo;system of records&rdquo; under the Privacy Act. Not all systems containing PII may meet the definition of a &ldquo;system of records.&rdquo; However, all PII maintained by an organization must be protected irrespective of whether the PII is subject to the Privacy Act.Regarding TR-2, paragraph c, the Privacy Act Statement, when required, should be provided in the same format as the information is collected. For example, an electronic statement on a website, a written statement on a paper form, and a verbal statement provided for information that is collected verbally.\n"

Consistent with the Fair Information Practice Principles (FIPP) and Section 208 of the E-Government Act, the organization's internal use of PII not contained in a SORN should be compatible with the purpose for which it was originally collected and as described in the PIA or other public notice.Organizations take steps to ensure that they use PII only for legally authorized purposes and in a manner compatible with uses identified in the Privacy Act and/or in public notices. These steps include monitoring and auditing organizational use of PII and training organizational personnel on the authorized uses of PII. With guidance from the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) and where appropriate, legal counsel, organizations document processes and procedures for evaluating any proposed new uses of PII to assess whether they fall within the scope of the organizational authorities. Where appropriate, organizations obtain consent from individuals for the new use(s) of PII.The phrase &ldquo;authorization schema&rdquo; refers to the logic of how authorization permissions are designed to function within the system (e.g., by group, by role, by transaction type, etc.). An example of an authorization schema where permissions appropriately match functions would be a schema where a group of &ldquo;reviewers&rdquo; is separate from a group of &ldquo;approvers.&rdquo; Individuals assigned to the &ldquo;reviewer&rdquo; group could read PII and make recommendations, but not approve actions. Individuals in the &ldquo;approver&rdquo; group could read recommendations and approve actions. An authorization schema where all individuals are automatically authorized to approve all actions is an example of a schema where the alignment between permissions and functions may be inappropriate.\n"

Consideration of privacy risks for sharing PII apply regardless of the method used or whether the information remains stored in the system of records. Data removed from an information system covered by a system of records notice (e.g., a Human Resources [HR] database) and shared in another format (e.g., an Excel spreadsheet) must still meet purpose and use requirements of the associated notice. PII not in a system of records that is shared with a third party still must meet the Purpose Specification and, relatedly, Use Limitation FIPPs. For example, data extracts of PII shared via an Excel spreadsheet or database archive must still be shared only if consistent with purposes set out in notices provided to the individual, and in any consent or authorization received from that individual.A &ldquo;third party&rdquo; for these purposes is an individual or organization other than CMS and the individual about whom CMS collects and uses information.The organization SOP and, where appropriate, legal counsel, review and approve any proposed external sharing of PII, including with other public, international, or private sector entities, for consistency with uses described in the existing organizational public notice(s). When a proposed new instance of external sharing of PII is not currently authorized by the Privacy Act and/or specified in a notice, organizations evaluate whether the proposed external sharing is compatible with the purpose(s) specified in the notice. If the proposed sharing is compatible, organizations review, update, and republish their privacy impact assessment (PIA), SORN, website privacy policies, and other public notices, if any, to include specific descriptions of the new uses(s) and obtain consent where appropriate and feasible. Information-sharing agreements also include security protections consistent with the sensitivity of the information being shared.\n\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\n\nUnder HIPAA Privacy Rule, a covered entity may not use, disclose or request a medical record, except when the medical record is specifically justified as the amount that is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose of the use, disclosure, or request.
