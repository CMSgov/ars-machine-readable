# Acceptable Risk Safeguards #

## About ##

This is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services Compliance as Code repository repository. It contains a copy of the Acceptable Risk Safeguards in machine-readable formats. These formats provide machine-readable representations of control catalogs and control baselines and aim to support the development of system security plans, assessment plans and results. 

CMS believes compliance activity at scale require automation to be successful and repeatable. Compliance as Code standards like OSCAL allow teams to bridge between the "Governance" layer and operational tools.  

## About ARS ##
The goal of the Acceptable Risk safeguards is define a baseline of minimum information security and privacy assurance controls (i.e., the CMSR baselines). These controls are based on both internal CMS governance documents and laws, regulations, and other authorities created by institutions external to CMS. 

Protecting and ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability for all of CMSâ€™ information and information systems is the primary purpose of the information security and privacy assurance program. The ARS complies with the CMS IS2P26 by providing a defense-in-depth security structure along with a least-privilege, need-to-know basis for all information access. 

## Using ##
Confirm you're using the latest version of the ARS controls.
