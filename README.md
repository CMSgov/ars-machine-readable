This is the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services repository that provides the Acceptable Risk Safeguards (ARS) in machine-readable format to support compliance as code initiatives.

With this repository, CMS aims to support innovative teams in leveraging automation to improve the CMS security posture and reduce the burden of compliance.

## Using this ##
If you're looking to ship software to production at CMS, your system will need to comply with ARS controls. Product teams looking to automate compliance (including but not limited to automatically generating their System Security Plans) can use these machine-readable ARS controls to support their efforts.
